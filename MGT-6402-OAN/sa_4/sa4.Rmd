## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r factors, include=FALSE}
factors <- read.csv('C:/Users/mjpearl/Desktop/omsa/MGT-6402-OAN/sa_4/factors.csv')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
lm1 <- lm(Brk_exret ~ RF, data = factors)
summary(lm1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
lm2 <- lm(Brk_exret ~ Mkt_rf + SMB + HML, data = factors)
summary(lm2)
```
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
lm3 <- lm(Brk_exret ~ Mkt_rf + SMB + HML + Mom + BAB+ QMJ, data = factors)
summary(lm3)
```
