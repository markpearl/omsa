Homework 1 README

Q2)

The code for question 2 for the k-medoids can k-means implementation can be found in the clustering python package. 

To run the clustering models, navigate to Scripts/run_clustering.py and run the code in terminal. Ensure that the working directory of your editor is the root for the homework, as the scripts are going to need to be able to access the data files under the ./data folder. You can see the output result images in the root directory with the prefix "compressed".

Q3-4)
The code for these questions can be found in the Q3-Q4.ipynb jupyter notebook with the sklearn package used to calculate the principal components.
