I had a lady walk in today curious to know what we do. After a little chat, it was clear that she thought she was too old to start to exercise. She was 71.

After she left, I couldn’t get that out of my head because older adults have even more reason to exercise. It brought me to write this post in hopes that you can share this with someone with a similar attitude.

Here are the 4 big reasons any older adult should exercise.

<strong>1. Disease prevention</strong>

Resistance exercise builds bone density, re-boosts metabolism to burn fat, prevents sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass). Combined with cardiovascular exercise it has been shown to help prevent mental illnesses cancers and heart disease.

<strong>2. Well being</strong>

It’s not just about living longer it’s about living better. Having the energy to do the things you love to do like playing with grandchildren or having the endurance to do things you may not have done like go for a walk or a hike.

<strong>3. Hormones</strong>

As you age your hormone levels are on a slow decline and the only natural way to stop this decline is to take up resistance training. Every time you lift weight, you stimulate your hormones to start building again making you look and feel younger.

<strong>4. Function and mobility</strong>

If you don’t exercise or stretch your muscles on a regular basis they will lose range motion which will leave you feeling stiff and restricted. Basic things like reaching down to pick something up or getting out of the car become a struggle. With a good resistance program combined with stretching and cardiovascular work you can easily gain back your mobility and feel like a million bucks!",,7099,2017-12-05 14:29:15,2017-12-05 19:29:15,closed,open,age-right-age-exercise,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,personal-trainer-articles,Personal Trainer Articles,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,7100,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,25,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,shared_counts,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,shared_counts_datetime,1594739890,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,Make Your Next Workout a Total HIIT,https://freeformfitness.ca/make-next-workout-total-hiit/,"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 18:52:52 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7104,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Are you looking to step your game up in the gym? Do you want to improve your heart health but dread spending anymore than 10 minutes on the cardio machines? Well then we have the solution for you! This week we will be breaking down the popular training style known as HIIT so that next time you </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">hit </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the gym your workout will be a total </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">hiit.</span></i><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7105"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/image.jpg"" alt="""" width=""863"" height=""355"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HIIT, or </span><b>High Intensity Interval Training</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, is one of the most popular fitness trends right now as it is cutting down time on the cardio machines, and making a big difference in people’s fitness levels. So if you are one of those people who can’t stand running/cycling/stairmaster-ing/rowing for 30+ minutes straight, but you still want all of the benefits, HIIT is definitely for you!</span><b>So how do you HIIT?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The key part of HIIT is that it has to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">actually</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> be </span><b>high</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> intensity. In all of the studies I reviewed to write this article, the </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25771785""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HIIT protocol </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">required participants to train at 85%-95% of their max heart rate during the working portion of the intervals. So if you want to try HIIT, you have to be prepared to really push yourself during the effort interval if you want to reap the rewards. In terms of how to structure your intervals, most protocols use a 1:1 effort to rest ratio. So if you decide to hop on a treadmill, you would sprint for 1 minute, and then lightly jog or briskly walk for the following minute and then repeat that for your prescribed time. </span><b>Speaking of rewards…</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Efficiency is everything when it comes to HIIT. Whether you are finishing off a strength training session with some bodyweight HIIT, or just trying to get a quick sweat going on the treadmill, HIIT will cut down the time you are required to workout, without sacrificing any benefits that you would get from a moderate intensity, continuous training style program. A </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25771785""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">review</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> published in the Journal for Sports Medicine looked at years worth of studies and examined the effectiveness of HIIT on cardiovascular fitness. They concluded that HIIT was more effective than MICT (moderate intensity continuous training) when it came to improving vascular function, and improving insulin sensitivity in participants. A </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4427241/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> published in the Journal of Physical Sports Medicine tested this type of training on obese men and found that </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“Focusing on lifestyle improvements, integrating short duration, high-intensity training appears to be an effective strategy for enhancing health in a short period of time in overweight/obese men.”</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They also reported that this form of exercise was well tolerated by the participants and had 100% compliance with no events of adverse effects. One </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4696187/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> out of Australia is even looking at how HIIT can help women quit smoking! For those of you looking to boost your peak power output, a </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29199186""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> published in the Journal of Musculoskeletal Neuronal Interaction found that HIIT training improved peak power output, and increased spinal spinal excitability. Lastly, for all of our long distance runners out there, HIIT can benefit you too! Medicine and Science in Sports Exercise published a </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25984891""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that found that trained runners could improve their maximum velocity at their VO2 max, improve their VO2 max, and improve their submaximal heart rate during exercise.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/be-a.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7111"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/be-a.jpg"" alt="""" width=""354"" height=""266"" /></a><b>Last but not least!</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Safety is always important. As with all things in the health and wellness field, HIIT is not a one-size-fits-all workout. Someone may need 8-9mph to get their heart rate up during the effort interval, but someone else may need a walking pace on an incline to get their heart rate up. If you do decide to include HIIT into your workout regime, make sure you do what is enough for </span><b>you</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Want more information on HIIT?

2,Have Yourself a Merry Little Fitmas,https://freeformfitness.ca/merry-little-fitmas/,"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 15:45:24 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7123,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If the busy malls, deck’d out halls, and lit up houses - big and small - are any indication, it seems the holidays are upon us. This is a time to spend with the ones you love, and to appreciate all the things, good and bad, that have happened this past year. Gifts are being purchased and parties are being attended, and although these are all a fun part of the holidays, it can also mean your fitness goals are put on the back burner. This week we are going to give you a few tips and tricks to help you avoid the holiday bulk-up, all while enjoying all the magic that the holiday season brings!</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/home-alone.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7124"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/home-alone.jpg"" alt="""" width=""499"" height=""382"" /></a><b>Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although there are many enjoyable aspects of the holidays, it can also be incredibly stressful. The weather is changing and that means commutes are getting slower. Buying gifts means spending money. Holiday parties means most of your free-time after work and on the weekends is monopolized by social gatherings, potlucks, and maybe even a night-or-two out on the town. The malls are busy, the parking lots at the mall are a nightmare, and as a student this time of year means exams and final projects. All of these are inevitable this time of year but how you decide to respond to it can change everything!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So for our first tip we suggest that you try not to sweat the small stuff! If you know you are heading into traffic, throw on a podcast, listen to your favourite music and practice patience. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Heading to the malls to knock some items off of your loved one’s Christmas lists? Make a game plan before you go, make sure your step-tracker is powered up, and challenge yourself to hit your step-goals AND get all of the gifts you need! </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Off to an event and are worried about what to bring or that you may cheat on your diet? </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16260065""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stress </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">can actually cause us to reach for highly palatable foods (ie. salty, sweet, and fatty foods). So try bringing something to the party that will not only keep you on track, but will be a great option for anyone else at the party who is trying to stay on track! If you are heading to a dinner, check out the menu before hand and pick what you know will benefit you and your health goals. Having a small meal beforehand can also make it easier to choose a healthier option on the menu (and will save money!).</span><b>Keep It Simple</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/charlie-brown.gif""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7127 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/charlie-brown.gif"" alt="""" width=""220"" height=""158"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This goes into the common-sense category of advice, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">but it is worth mentioning. Instead of trying to fit everything you have to do in between all of the holiday festivities try picking your priorities, making a modified schedule for those, and know that once the holidays are over, you can go back to your pre-Christmas ways. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">More often than not people see the end of the year approaching and take on an extreme new diet or exercise regime to prepare themselves for the New Year. If you have a great fitness regime going on already and the way you are eating is supporting your health, then don’t over-complicate your life by introducing some new restriction or another day at the gym. Enjoy holiday treats in moderation but keep in mind that once the holidays are over you will go back to the way you were eating. Hitting the gym more during/after the holidays to work off those holiday treats makes exercise a punishment for indulgence. Exercise should never be seen as a punishment. Keep getting your workouts in and know that once the holidays are over and all the cookies and cakes have been enjoyed that your workouts and nutrition will get you right back on track.</span><b>Enjoy what you </b><b><i>Really</i></b><b> Love
<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/elf.gif""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7126 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/elf.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""244"" /></a></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Okay, maybe not that much, everything in moderation of course! This tip is all about making conscious decisions when you are out at holiday events where treats are on offer. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you think about some of your favourite holiday treats what come to mind? Now when you are at a party and there is an entire table of tasty desserts and snacks, I bet your favourite holiday treat is on the table mixed in with a number of other things. If you have waited all year to have your aunt’s special Christmas cookies, then by all means, have 1 or 2 of those, but then </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ask yourself why you are getting more than that? Is it because you love it and really want it? Or is it because it is available to you? This simple check-in with yourself will help you to avoid overindulging!</span>

Give Yourself the Gift of Good Health

3,This New Year Don't Be Just Another Statistic,https://freeformfitness.ca/new-year-dont-just-another-statistic/,"Tue, 02 Jan 2018 16:03:51 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7177,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Happy New Year to all of our wonderful readers of the blog! You may be reading this after your morning workout, or maybe after trying a new recipe that is going to kick start your new year’s resolution to eat better. This time of year is filled with new goals, gym membership sign ups, and the setting of great expectations to make this year the best one yet. As fitness professionals we are so excited that more people are making a commitment to improving their health. Unfortunately we all know too well how quickly these commitments turn into loose promises, and eventually become a lost cause. It is troubling to see the statistics that are stacked against those who are trying to improve their health. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of the top 10 new year’s resolutions, 7 of them are related to improving health. These include:</span><ul><li>Exercise more (38 per cent)</li><li>Lose weight (33 per cent)</li><li>Eat more healthily (32 per cent)</li><li>Take a more active approach to health (15 per cent)</li><li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Learn new skill or hobby (15 per cent) </span></li><li>Spend more time on personal wellbeing (12 per cent)</li><li><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spend more time with family and friends (12 per cent) </span></li><li>Drink less alcohol (12 per cent)</li><li>Stop smoking (9 per cent)</li><li><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Other (1 per cent)
</span></span></li></ul>
From the <a href=""http://www.comresglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/BUPA_NY-Resolution_Public-Polling_Nov-15_UPDATED-TABLES.pdf"">same poll</a>, they reported that of the people who made new year’s resolutions, 63% of them failed. There are <a href=""https://www.creditdonkey.com/gym-membership-statistics.html"">reports</a> out there that present even higher rates of failure. For all of the people who join the gym in January, <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-new-gym-members-in-January-stop-coming-after-February"">at least 80%</a> of them quit by the second month of February. These are shocking numbers and worry us even more because feelings of failure, and the extremely restrictive diets that people put themselves on in the month of January, often lead to people regaining the weight and even leave the individuals in poorer health than they were prior to January.

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/giphy.gif""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7178"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/giphy.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""284"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Free Form we do not want you to become one of these statistics. We believe that goal setting is an important part of living a healthy life and therefore making a New Year’s resolution to improve your health in any aspect is amazing! So here are our tips on how to stick to your New Year’s resolution and avoid being just another statistic.</span><b>Start Small</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Look at your whole life and pick 1 thing that you think would be easy to improve. Instead of saying I am going to quit smoking cold turkey, or, “I am going to lose X amount of weight this year”, pick something like “I am going to stop having a smoke when I am at work” or “I am going to get myself to the gym regularly every week”. </span><b>Keep Your Whole Life in Perspective</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Making a New Year’s Resolution can make people feel like they only have the next 12 months to get to their goal. Some people even make resolutions to get themselves in shape for beach season, adding extra pressure to look perfect in just 4-5 months. If you are looking to improve your health and well being this year think about it as something to improve your health and well being for </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the rest of your life</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. So if you slip up one week because family or work stress throws you off your game, know that you didn’t lose 1 of the 52 weeks you have to reach your goal, because 1 week is really a small amount of time in the grand scheme of life. </span><b>Celebrate the Little Wins</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/giphy-1.gif""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7180"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/giphy-1.gif"" alt="""" width=""280"" height=""235"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Somewhat related to the first tip - celebrating the little wins allows you to feel successful on a regular basis. If you only allow yourself to feel accomplished when you reach the major milestones and goals in your life, then you lose out on feeling good about yourself and life for all the time leading up to it. If you goal is to quit smoking this year, celebrate the days when you smoke less than you did before. If you want to eat better, celebrate the days when you reached for a salad instead of the pasta dish, or celebrate the days when you practiced moderation for every meal. When you reward yourself mentally, the journey towards your ultimate health and wellness goals become much more enjoyable and will lead to greater adherence to your plan.</span><b>Speaking of plans…</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/make-your-plan-620x350.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7179"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/make-your-plan-620x350.jpg"" alt="""" width=""620"" height=""350"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Making a plan for yourself can help keep you focused. Similarly to how a personal training program allows us to track your progress and success, making a plan for yourself can help you track your progress and success along the way. Adding in rewards throughout the year to help keep you on track can make planning out your goals exciting. Lastly, if you are making a goal that has a specific time frame in mind, include a re-evaluation at the end of that time frame. So often we see people say they are going to get healthy in time for a wedding or birthday and then they do! But then they go right back to their old ways and all of that hard work they put in was for nothing. Have your goals serve you long term by evaluating the successes and failures of resolutions, and then learn from those to create a new resolution for the next time frame. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We really want to see everyone succeed and make 2018 the year where we all do something to make ourselves a little bit more healthy and happy! Try some of these tips out when you’re making your New Year’s Resolutions and let us know how they worked for you!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From all of us here at Free Form Fitness - Have a safe, happy and healthy New Year! -</span><b> FFF</b>",,7177,2018-01-02 11:03:51,2018-01-02 16:03:51,closed,open,new-year-dont-just-another-statistic,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,personal-trainer-articles,Personal Trainer Articles,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,7178,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,25,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,shared_counts,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,shared_counts_datetime,1594791611,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

5,3 Reasons You Should Try LISS,https://freeformfitness.ca/3-reasons-try-liss/,"Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:20:13 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7205,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A few weeks ago we posted about HIIT - or high intensity interval training. This method of exercise takes a short amount of time and really challenges the body to perform at maximum effort many times over. What about those days when you don’t need to be in a rush, or you’re tired but still want to get in a good workout? To that we say you should try LISS!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">LISS stands for </span><b>low intensity steady state</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and is a form of cardiovascular training that has you working at 40-70% of your predicted maximum heart rate (220-age) for greater than 20 minutes. This form of exercise, like most forms of exercise, has many benefits and will be a great addition to your workout regime - and here’s why:</span><strong>1. Lower intensity makes this safer than HIIT</strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Mike-Running-on-Treadmill-Monsters-Inc.gif""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7206 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Mike-Running-on-Treadmill-Monsters-Inc.gif"" alt="""" width=""450"" height=""253"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although HIIT is an awesome way to get the heart up and break a really good sweat, working at higher intensities puts some of us at a greater risk for injury and could potentially lead to exertion-related illnesses and conditions. For individuals with high blood pressure, angina, or other pressure and exertion related cardiovascular disease, attempting a high intensity interval workout could exacerbate your symptoms. This is why LISS is an excellent alternative. You can get all the benefits of HIIT without putting your heart at risk. In fact regular LISS workouts can improve biometrics like blood pressure and cholesterol levels by increasing the production of HDL cholesterol and therefore lowering LDL levels, all while improving the health and function of the cardiovascular system. </span><strong>2. Excellent for active recovery</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For all of you high-intensity junkies, LISS could be a great way to get you in the gym on those days where you really don’t feel like resting. Due to the minimum impact on the muscles, LISS can act as an </span><a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004210000365?LI=true""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">active recovery tool.</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> By increasing the heart rate gradually you are activating the aerobic, or long-duration, energy system your body. This breaks down fat cells, releasing toxins from the body. It also shuttles lots of oxygen to the muscles, which helps them to recover from previous strenuous exercise. This includes</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1320372/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> lowering lactate levels</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in the muscles ie. decreasing muscle soreness.</span><strong>3. Take the time to unwind</strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/giphy-2.gif""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7207 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/giphy-2.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""272"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In a society that is already so driven by speed and running from one task to the next, LISS can be your multi-tasking fitness friend. Since it takes longer to achieve the health benefits using this style of training, you are required to dedicate 20 minutes to 1 hour to just one thing. In those 20 minutes to 1 hour let your body’s incredible systems take over and give your mind just one thing to focus on. While you walk/jog/cycle for this extended period of time, your body will be decreasing its inflammatory markers, it will be reducing the amount of cortisol in the blood - a hormone linked to stress - it will be breaking down fat cells and releasing toxins, blood flow and nutrients will be shuttled to the working muscles and any other organs that are in need of repair and recovery. </span><b>HIIT v.s LISS</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although we presented some amazing benefits of HIIT before, we also thought it would be important to present the other option for cardiovascular training. Both methods will improve your cardiovascular fitness but you need to decide which method works best for your life. Are you someone who has high blood pressure or another pressure and exertion related condition? Then maybe skip the HIIT for now, and focus on LISS. Are you someone who knows they need to take the time to unwind after a crazy week of work or school? Then set aside some extra time to include LISS in your weekly workout schedule to help you reduce stress levels all while improving muscular function and cardiovascular health. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a final note - LISS is not “better” than HIIT and the same is true about HIIT not being better than LISS. As with all things to do with our health, we need to look at what is best for us as an individual. All of these different training modalities should be seen as tools in a toolbox. Some tools work better for different goals than others, but the more tools you have in your tool box means that when new challenges arise, you are well equipped to tackle them.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Give LISS a shot and let us know in the comments how it worked for you! - </span><b>FFF</b>",,7205,2018-01-08 12:20:13,2018-01-08 17:20:13,closed,open,3-reasons-try-liss,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,_edit_last,8,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,_thumbnail_id,7206,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,taptap-hide-checkbox,,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595045153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,Cardio Before or After You Workout?,https://freeformfitness.ca/cardio-before-or-after-you-workout/,"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 16:12:31 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7221,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is the ultimate dilemma in the gym: Do you jump on the treadmill before lifting weights or do you finish the workout with the treadmill? One helps you warm up before the workout, and one finishes the workout with a good amount of sweat. On the flip side of that, starting with cardio can tire people out and discourage them from lifting weights, while other people choose not to include cardio at the end because they are tired from weightlifting. So which one is the better option? </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Quick disclaimer: including any form of cardio, whether it be LISS (low intensity steady state - see blog post </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/3-reasons-try-liss/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) or HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training - see blog post </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/make-next-workout-total-hiit/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">), will always be good for your health no matter where you put it in your workout. Regular exercise that trains the heart and lungs will always serve you well in life. What we are going to present in this article is where cardio fits in with your body’s natural energy systems. </span><b>ATP-CP System - Explosive Energy</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/usain.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-7222"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/usain-1024x683.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""683"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your body has 3 main energy systems running at all times. The first is your explosive energy system, (or ATP-CP system in technical terms). This system breaks down the creatine in your body to burn ATP - your body’s energy molecule. It works for about 0-10s and doesn’t require oxygen to complete the reaction. This energy system is what the body primarily uses when doing things like 1 rep-max lifts. It is also used in sprinting and other fast events that require an immediate burst of energy. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The next energy system is your short-duration energy system (or the glycolytic system). This system is very good at breaking down the body’s sugar stores to give us energy. This system works for about 10s-2 minutes and also does not require any amount of oxygen to allow the reaction to occur. This is also where lactic acid begins to build up in the muscles. Breaking down sugar without oxygen - very simply put - is how we create lactic acid. This is the energy system our body uses for our single-set exercises. It is readily available as long as our body has glucose in storage - which we always do from our food and body processes like </span><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/gluconeogenesis""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">gluconeogenesis</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">!</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/anigif_enhanced-buzz-31449-1390413196-0.gif""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7223 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/anigif_enhanced-buzz-31449-1390413196-0.gif"" alt="""" width=""405"" height=""219"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The final energy system is the long-duration energy system. We can use this system for energy for a limitless amount of time. As long as there is oxygen and fat stores available, this system will give us the energy to sit on the couch, go for a walk, and even complete a marathon. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although all of these energy systems are usually always working, the ratio of explosive to short-duration to long-duration is always changing depending on the activity. So when you come in for a workout at Free Form and jump right into your set of squats, your explosive energy system will kick in to help you get those first few reps in. Then the short-duration energy system will pick up the rest of the sets once the creatine supplies are depleted. So at the end of your workout, chances are you have worked through most of your explosive energy sources, most of your immediate glucose stores and therefore the energy system that will support the end of your workout in the long-duration energy system. </span><strong>So what does that all mean?</strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shrug.gif""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7224 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shrug.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""228"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To return to our original dilemma of when to do your cardio, we can look at it from an energy-system perspective. If you jump on the treadmill and start running right away, chances are you haven’t consumed enough oxygen to get the long-duration energy system going to use that at the beginning of the run. So your body will burn through the explosive energy system and the short-duration energy system while your body increases its breathing rate to match it’s oxygen needs to its oxygen consumption. So when you get off the treadmill, now all you have to lift weights with is your long-duration energy system. It will work but you won’t get the same explosive energy for your lifts. </span><blockquote>If your goal in the gym is to get the most from your weight lifting sessions, then from  a physiological stand-point putting your cardio at the end of your workout is best. If you are going to take your workout at a steady pace and the strength of your lifts is not a priority than you can easily get away with doing your cardio at the beginning of the session.</blockquote><span style=""font-weight: 400;""></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">See our blog post on HIIT workouts and their benefits </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/make-next-workout-total-hiit/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and see the benefits of LISS </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/3-reasons-try-liss/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.Cardio Before or After You Workou</span>",,7221,2018-01-15 11:12:31,2018-01-15 16:12:31,closed,open,cardio-before-or-after-you-workout,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,personal-trainer-articles,Personal Trainer Articles,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,25,_thumbnail_id,7222,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,shared_counts,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,shared_counts_datetime,1595257119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,4 ways to maintain motivation,https://freeformfitness.ca/4-ways-maintain-motivation/,"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 14:31:50 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7235,"<blockquote><div><div><div><div><div dir=""ltr""><div>

In our new year’s blog post we presented the stats on New Year’s resolutions. At this point, a large percentage of New Year’s resolutions have already been abandoned and many more are going to follow in the coming weeks. This past <span class=""aBn"" tabindex=""0"" data-term=""goog_1970019080""><span class=""aQJ"">Monday</span></span> was also the infamous “<a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_(date)&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1516567855835000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFYep3yt3YTK7nCbRpQ51wt8M5qCg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_(date)%26sa%3DD%26ust%3D1516567855835000%26usg%3DAFQjCNFYep3yt3YTK7nCbRpQ51wt8M5qCg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1516717488606000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdXQh8afW1A9RHxqsyWxWe8hD8OQ"">blue Monday</a>” - apparently the saddest day of the year. With the rush of enthusiasm and energy from the holidays slowly starting to fade and we settle back into our daily routines, it is increasingly easier to let those new year’s resolutions slide. For many of us reading this from Ottawa, we are also having to adapt to some crazy weather, which can sap our energy and leave us looking to curl up on the couch to binge on Netflix and comfort food. This week we thought it was important to give you some tools to get yourself back on track and not only boost motivation, but also maintain that motivation.

<img class=""CToWUd a6T"" tabindex=""0"" title="""" src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Y4WG7kVZT0cLk3Iks4Kzj3oP-Gev7lIlei5O8fZ6muhXEp64WZux449NJLbVfrsWJlbHw7xi7IdQyS-qXOLmeGvRovO40oU382rQ5qRG5HHu7Mh-nHZ2ewm6gTO8tk1daTNlQ-Nn"" alt="""" />

To start, motivation is not a zero-sum game - ie. you can’t expect to be motivated 100% of the time. There are going to be really good days and there are going to be really bad days. In fact, researchers have <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower-limited-resource.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1516567855835000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEt8yCTtKDQadHlT77Pf7XQUdagrA"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.apa.org/helpcenter/willpower-limited-resource.pdf%26sa%3DD%26ust%3D1516567855835000%26usg%3DAFQjCNEt8yCTtKDQadHlT77Pf7XQUdagrA&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1516717488606000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHWbjQWk0i4tZaaoxHnb-KSol4iFg"">discovered</a> that your will-power - which works hand-in-hand with motivation - is in limited supply every day. Like your muscles, your will power can be fatigued when overused. Which brings us to our first tip to maintain motivation:

&nbsp;

<strong>1. Know your limit - play within it</strong>

&nbsp;

Along with being a great motto for all things in life, this tip is all about taking things step-by-step. Some of you may have made some really ambitious goals at the beginning of the month, and that is great! What you need to reflect on is that the steps you take to get there are just that - steps - not leaps and bounds. Asking yourself to make a complete 180 from old habits to new, healthier ones will exhaust your will power and leave you feeling depleted of motivation. Once depleted, you will find it very difficult to hit the gym instead of the snooze button. Look at the goals you made this year and re-evaluate how you are going to reach them, keeping your limited will-power in mind.

&nbsp;

<strong>2. Build your goals into your routine</strong>

&nbsp;

Dipping into the daily will-power bank is only required when we have to resist the temptation to do something else. So if you really want your healthy resolutions to stick, they need to become something that is a part of your everyday life. Once getting to your training sessions, or meal prepping become part of that group of auto-pilot-activities, then there will be no other temptation to resist because it won’t even be a decision at that point. Many of our clients have shared with us that once exercises became a part of their routine, missing sessions required will-power.<img class=""CToWUd a6T"" tabindex=""0"" title="""" src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8LKU8Gm-k9hfI_q5HPxI_SSyJ9HPzB2tMKFsV3I6trJ_RIFHn92ilRi5doVKhz2wqfreTObpRGp1ULk4_0EISvqzGYFPYIUO5zE1QkT8Fxz_0A73vsvUfTaWICeq80uJAlQ6Nl-2"" alt="""" />

&nbsp;

<strong>3. Expect the Unexpected</strong>

&nbsp;

So now that you have hacked your will power and made your healthy choices part of your daily/weekly routine, what happens when something comes up that you can’t get out of? Your kids get sick; your study group can only meet at one time and it is during your training session; the grocery store doesn’t have one of the ingredients for your favourite meal; there’s a major family or work event that you can’t skip out on. Do you skip your training session? Do you skip making that meal and grab something on the go? Absolutely not. Having a back up plan to help you stay on track means that you can never be thrown off your game. Even for life’s unexpected events, you can always be prepared so that you never have to sacrifice your goals. If you know that you have to be away for an event or you are travelling for work, either check ahead to see if where you’ll be has a gym or somewhere you can get out for some bodyweight exercises and cardio, or condense your workouts before you leave so that you don’t hinder the progression of your training. For those of you with dietary goals, have at least 2 or 3 back up meals that you love and can make in a pinch if something comes up and you are unable to make your planned meal for that day. Preparation is our best defence against the unpredictability of our daily lives, and will help you maintain motivation through even the craziest of days.

&nbsp;

<strong>4. Celebrate Little-Wins</strong>

&nbsp;

The power of positivity and optimism should not be taken lightly. It is widely understood in the neuroscience community that <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18320725&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1516567855837000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDrYgj4KE4FOjIJ6R2axYd3FHz-Q"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18320725%26sa%3DD%26ust%3D1516567855837000%26usg%3DAFQjCNEDrYgj4KE4FOjIJ6R2axYd3FHz-Q&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1516717488606000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH0f-DiJq-4j1Zh_mI7KM1xfrYZrw"">dopamine</a> plays an important role in motivation. Dopamine release in the brain is linked to situations of success and reward, which really is subjective to everyone. What we believe to be a successful event in our lives, may not be successful to someone else. What this means is we can actually control the reward system in our brain by rewarding ourselves with little-wins every day. The more little wins, the more dopamine, and therefore the longer our motivation will last. Celebrating little wins is so simple! You just have to be open to viewing simple things as something worth celebrating. It’s as easy as seeing something like actually pushing through the final reps even though you thought you were done - as something to be excited about. <img class=""CToWUd alignleft"" title="""" src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TFNzDJqg4mEni8hzMglouc_PLE4vCc1uXS6qvjabNGlIf3TadwH31FRkKeGaRMoZF8vWV-yjpvsKjpniuHLTdWbg13DyUj1HX6FBDVGzbXgDDWjXwKYF71BX51wUFJevRY5HKElQ"" alt="""" />

On a final note, if your New Year’s resolutions have fallen by the wayside in the last few days, don’t let that discourage you. Just because you didn’t do it perfectly doesn’t mean you have to give up on it entirely. Pick up right where you left off and try using some of these tips to maintain your motivation and continue working towards accomplishing this year’s goals.

Let us know in the comments what helps you maintain your motivation!

8,4 supplements you need to know about,https://freeformfitness.ca/4-supplements-need-know/,"Tue, 30 Jan 2018 14:35:43 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7243,"In today’s busy society, dietary supplements have become a necessary part of our lives in order for us to meet many of our daily nutrient requirements. As humans push the limits of training
and exercise, many supplements have been developed to help us further explore the farthest reaches of human physical ability. The only issue is that there are so many different
supplements out there, with names straight out of chemistry class, that it becomes a daunting task to try and figure out which ones are best for you and your needs. This week we are going
to give you a quick break down of a few common supplements, and hopefully provide you with a little more clarity on the importance of supplements.

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/fish-oil.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7244 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/fish-oil.jpg"" alt="""" width=""98"" height=""134"" /></a><strong>Fish oils/Omega-3 Supplements</strong>
Fish oil and omega-3 supplements are popular supplements on the market today and that’s because most of us are not getting enough of these crucial fatty acids in our diet. The world health organization recommends we have 2 servings of fish per week. If we are unable to do so, then it is recommended that you take 300mg of combined EPA and DHA omega-3’s daily.

Many fish oil supplements will label their bottle with 1000mg of fish oil on their bottle. That is the total fish oil. Make sure you read the label to ensure there is a combined amount of 300mg of EPA and DHA in the supplement.

Why Do We Need Them?
There is a lot of research into the why we need omega-3’s in our diet (1, 2, 3, 4). Our brain requires a good supply of omega 3 fatty acids in order to function well and omega-3’s have even been cited to improve focus in children with attention deficit disorders, as well as improve the mental stability of humans into adulthood. If that isn’t enough of a good reason to be taking omega-3’s, there have been a number of studies on how supplementing fish oils and omega-3 supplements can decrease your risk of developing heart disease (5, 6).

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/bcaa.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7245 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/bcaa.jpg"" alt="""" width=""138"" height=""161"" /></a><strong>BCAA’s</strong>
BCAA’s, or Branch-Chained Amino Acids, are a group of amino acids required to build a number of proteins in the body. These amino acids are leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Many studies have been done on
the effectiveness of BCAA supplementation and what we have learned is that we a dosage of 7g of BCAA’s is required to see any benefit, and that they do have the potential to aid with muscle recovery and help
reduce the onset of DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) (7, 8, 9).

Why Do We Need Them?
As we mentioned above, supplementing with BCAA’s is a great way to decrease muscle soreness post-workout, and improve general recovery of the muscles after strength training sessions. BCAA supplementation has also been shown to decrease sarcopenia in patients with liver cirrhosis!

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/whey.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7246 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/whey.jpg"" alt="""" width=""152"" height=""185"" /></a><strong>Protein Powder</strong>
Protein powder is the ultimate supplement staple. When we exercise, we cause micro-tears in the muscles. In order to repair these micro-tears, our body needs to use amino acids to rebuild the muscle tissue and make us stronger for the next workout! Where do we get these amino acids? BCAA’s are a good place to start and the next source is a complete protein powder. If you are able to consume 20g-30g of protein post workout​ as well as the recommended 0.8g-1.8g of protein per kg of bodyweight in the form of natural food sources, than that is the best way to do it! For many of us, though, this is actually quite difficult. So supplementing with a protein powder means that you can get the protein you need, without having consume large quantities or meat or vegan protein sources throughout the day.

Types of Protein Powder
Casein: This is the most abundant type of protein in mammalian milk. It is digested more slowly, so the release of amino acids is more gradual (10) Whey: This type of protein also comes from mammalian milk sources. Unlike casein, whey protein is digested much faster, meaning the amino acids reach the bloodstream much faster (11) Whey-Isolate: This is the exact same as whey protein, except for that this form of protein goes through an additional level of filtration that removes the fat, cholesterol, and lactose, making it a more potent protein supplement. This is also why whey isolate supplements are usually more
expensive than normal whey supplements.

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/multivitamin.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7247 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/multivitamin.jpg"" alt="""" width=""108"" height=""161"" /></a><strong>Multivitamin</strong>
After protein powder, a multivitamin is another great staple supplement. These supplements offer a variety of vitamins and minerals in one pill or powder. A good quality multi-vitamin provides you with high doses of most of the essential nutrients you require in order to function optimally. Keep in mind that cramming so many nutrients into pill or powder form can decrease the potency of the vitamins and minerals, which is why this is a *supplement* and should be taken while eating a balanced diet of whole and nutrient-rich foods.

Next week we will be talking about sleep on the blog, so if you were hoping to learn more about vitamin D and melatonin supplementation, keep an eye out for next week’s blog.

This is a simple tip that can go a long way. Infact it would also help solve the sugarbesity going on with children. Here it is: Deserve the carbs you eat. Carbs are a source of energy and let's face it, our intake far out weighs our outtake. So if you have a computer job and you're sitting down most of the day, you don't really need much or even any carbs at that point. The brain is well fueled without it by the process of gluconeogenesis. So here's a rule that you can aply to help you stay on track: BEFORE you decide to eat any carbohydrate loaded meal you need to deserve it and have exercised your muscles hard to lower your blood sugar. It's simple but it works.",,7249,2018-02-05 12:25:53,2018-02-05 17:25:53,closed,open,easy-weight-loss-tip-2,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,7250,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,60,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,shared_counts,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,shared_counts_datetime,1594312292,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

People do not realize that they could have the best workout regime and nutrition and not see results because of poor sleeping habits. It is the blissful 6-8 hours of your day where you get to make effortless gains. It is our natural way of repairing and recovering the body and preparing us for the next day. With more caffeine, harmful light exposure, and increased daily stress creeping into our lives, we are putting this crucial part of our lives at risk, and thus putting our own long-term health at risk. This week we want to share with you why sleep is so important, and the quick fixes you can make to improve your sleep!

<strong>What Happens When You Sleep?</strong><img class=""CToWUd a6T"" tabindex=""0"" title="""" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MmoC-ZeiCG8Dgb5t3vQ_WF1gqTsY2PwI27rDd2iGPOCOn7wq4Z8ZLvFS8s8BO4KF7rYsQ_yfwq1JxH5SenABcj_kV1_Qc3qnq4Uy6r9k85DNhefAlyaZN5gr-Qr5Aq2s8-_J3z5W"" alt="""" />

Your brain cycles through 5 different phases throughout the night, each varying in brain activity and varying levels of “deep-ness” (ie. how difficult it is to wake you up). The most important phases of sleep are the deep sleep phase, where your healing delta waves occur, and REM sleep, or rapid eye movement sleep. During REM sleep we are temporarily paralyzed, allowing us to experience dreams, working through situations and emotions, without moving the body. Deep sleep, as explained in <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gartenberg_the_brain_benefits_of_deep_sleep_and_how_to_get_more_of_it&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1517790491794000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGnl4A6mObeh3UsatHCjwXBUXyj1w"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gartenberg_the_brain_benefits_of_deep_sleep_and_how_to_get_more_of_it%26sa%3DD%26ust%3D1517790491794000%26usg%3DAFQjCNGnl4A6mObeh3UsatHCjwXBUXyj1w&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1518011758904000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFTZynwFJ4gh5IVAQStp06gXfc0lw"">this</a> TED Talk, is the most important phase of sleep as it is the phase that includes the delta waves.

<strong>What Can You Do To Improve Your Sleep?</strong>

Vitamin D: In <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://examine.com/nutrition/can-supplemental-vitamind-improve-sleep/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1517790491795000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFp0Bs-uUnmuiRMipfPG_BTHSMMkg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://examine.com/nutrition/can-supplemental-vitamind-improve-sleep/%26sa%3DD%26ust%3D1517790491795000%26usg%3DAFQjCNFp0Bs-uUnmuiRMipfPG_BTHSMMkg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1518011758904000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGxhNLnyz0qf3FAQx3OHymptCR9xA"">this</a> study, participants in a double-blind study were either given a placebo, or a vitamin D supplement and their quality of sleep was monitored. In the group that was given vitamin D, their sleep quality improved significantly. Where the placebo group took close to an hour to fall asleep, the group taking vitamin D took an average of 39 minutes to fall asleep. The length of time they slept also improved after taking vitamin D. For the individuals supplementing with vitamin D, they were taking 3,000 IU of vitamin D3 daily.

Melatonin: Your sleep and wake cycles are controlled partially by the melatonin production in your body. Your exposure to natural sunlight, as well as your leptin and ghrelin levels all affect how much melatonin your body produces naturally. This is why avoiding late night munchies is important for good sleep, as well as getting sufficient amounts of sunlight when possible. If you work shift work, or find yourself trapped inside a building all day with no exposure to the sun, supplementing with melatonin 1-2 hours before you plan on going to bed can help boost your melatonin production and make it easier for you to sleep.<img class=""CToWUd alignleft"" title="""" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hFi8snxYLd7cOszDgHLXcC7vRurrKOxUrnKmYGizGKEwKfjxjBVScf01TVASwXdlHJlMKtbsChcDLtw4r5oJRfCHpys9lMyRbDzWQRbZ2rtOfojyG0yJTC5GWB2uP5Xdmj1cNoHp"" alt="""" />

Blue Light Filters:  Some of you may have noticed on your phones a built-in feature called a blue light filter. All of our devices - tablets, laptops, and mobile phones - emit a blue light. This blue light is the kind of light used in happy lights to help our bodies “phase shift” into an awakened state. When we use these devices late into the evening, our brain registers the blue light as a signal that it is still daylight outside and therefore does not produce melatonin in sufficient quantities to put us to sleep. Turning on the <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/block-blue-light-to-sleep-better&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1517790491796000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGmGv4ysWcfWr3iZWblbUGYrzeAg"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.healthline.com/nutrition/block-blue-light-to-sleep-better%26sa%3DD%26ust%3D1517790491796000%26usg%3DAFQjCNGGmGv4ysWcfWr3iZWblbUGYrzeAg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1518011758904000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEJIccqIpRw7zTCTbJMCTazkksAtw"">blue light filter </a>on your phone/tablet/laptop blocks this blue light and enables our brain to respond to the decrease in blue light by increasing our production of melatonin, and therefore preparing us to sleep.

Manipulate Leptin &amp; Ghrelin: As mentioned previously, <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?q=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id%3D10.1371/journal.pmed.0010062&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1517790491797000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHOQAvjefgd0Vs7qykXGUwnloibDQ"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id%253D10.1371/journal.pmed.0010062%26sa%3DD%26ust%3D1517790491797000%26usg%3DAFQjCNHOQAvjefgd0Vs7qykXGUwnloibDQ&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1518011758904000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEONB4tN0tXkiUFIAxr3lMiROFf8A"">leptin and ghrelin work with melatonin</a>. Ghrelin signals the body that we are hungry, and leptin is released when we are satiated. After a certain number of leptin secretions paired with a decrease in exposure to sunlight and blue light, the body starts to ramp up its production of melatonin. If we are eating late into the evening and are not turning on that blue light filter, then our body does not know that it is supposed to be preparing for bed. Aim to eat your last meal of the day 1 hour after you turn on your blue light filter.

Leaving some room in your healthy life to indulge in treats like these on special occasions such as Valentine’s day all a part of keeping things in a balance. In our motivation blog we mentioned that giving in to temptations is a good way to ensure we do not deplete our limited supply of will power. The key is to be smart about how you indulge. As with all dietary choices, there are good options and there are bad options. Your choice of chocolate is no exception. For this special Valentine’s day blog, we are going to help you make the best chocolate selection for your health.

<strong>Dark vs. Milk vs. White Chocolate</strong>

We should probably stress early on in this that we are not promoting mass consumption of chocolate. Although dark chocolate does boast some impressive health benefits, it’s sweeter siblings have more sugar than you should reach for in any situation. Not to mention the other ingredients they add to achieve maximum sweetness bring their own health risks. Here are the nutritional information labels on 3 different kinds of chocolate from Lindt to show you just how different the most common chocolate options are, in terms of nutritional value.

The more Cocoa the Better

So why is the first chocolate bar better than it’s sweeter counter parts? The cocoa in chocolate is what brings the most benefits to chocolate. Therefore the higher the concentration of cocoa, the more benefits the bar brings. Here are just some of the benefits of cocoa:

13,6 fitness myths,https://freeformfitness.ca/6-fitness-tricks/,"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 15:01:43 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7319,"These days there are so many sources to get your information. Facebook, youtube, twitter, google, pinterest, journals, newspapers, the news - the list goes on and on! With so much information out there, it can be difficult to discern what is true and what is totally bogus. Clever marketing schemes, research funded by larger corporations (hello sugar cover up), and online echo chambers are constantly feeding us information that isn’t always complete. This week we have chosen a few of our favourite fitness myths so we can de-bunk them and hopefully help save you time (and money!).

<strong>Teatoxes</strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/teatox.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7322 alignnone"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/teatox.jpg"" alt="""" width=""206"" height=""170"" /></a>

Never heard of these cleverly named beverages? Essentially these are pre-packaged tea blends that are supposed to help the consumer cleanse their bodies and shed unwanted pounds. The truth: they are laxatives with fancy packaging and cute marketing. The issue with this is that any toxins that your body is absorbing are being absorbed in the small intestine. When you consume the tea, the laxative effect clears out the large intestine - ie. the cleansing effects are minimal and your weight loss isn’t coming from fat loss, it is coming from water loss and waste removal. Prolonged use of these kinds of teas can actually cause severe diarrhea, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Best just to stick to your pure teas as these are packed with natural cleansing properties like flavanoids, which are powerful antioxidants.

<strong>Lifting makes you bulky</strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lifting.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7323 alignnone"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lifting.jpg"" alt="""" width=""224"" height=""149"" /></a>

I am not sure where this myth came from. For men, if they have the right balance of training volume and caloric intake, they have a good chance of increasing the size of their muscles. For women, due to our much lower levels of testosterone, it is actually quite difficult for women to make gains like men. It would take years of very specific dieting and very high volume training for a women to gain significant amounts of muscle mass. Those images that are out there of women with incredibly large, rippling, muscles most likely did not acquire those naturally. If you are a woman and are avoiding lifting weights because you do not want to get “bulky” you are missing out on some of the amazing benefits of weight lifting for women. Improved bone density, general strength increase, mood and hormone regulation, stress relief - the benefits far outweigh the very low chance of you getting too muscle-y.

<strong>As long as you are exercising, you can eat however you want</strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bad-diet.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7324 alignnone"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bad-diet.jpg"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""204"" /></a>

Ever finish a workout and think to yourself, “Well that was a good workout, now I can treat myself to whatever I want!”? We hope not, because 9 times out of 10, that is not true. Treat yourself to the kind of food that will help with muscle recovery, like a healthy dose of protein (20-30g within 45 minutes of the workout is optimal!). You may also be way overestimating how many calories you burned during the workout. In a harvard medical school study, they found that the average 155lb person burns about 112kcals/30 minutes of training, and
298kcals/30 minutes of circuit training. These numbers are an average estimation. Calorie burn is very specific to the individual, but these numbers are good to show you that treating yourself to a piece of cake, or a large pizza post workout is like taking 1 step forward, and 2 steps back.

<strong>Cardio is the only way to lose weight</strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cardio.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7325 alignnone"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cardio.jpg"" alt="""" width=""296"" height=""152"" /></a>

​Although long bouts of hard cardio training does burn a lot of calories, it is not sustainable way to lose weight. These forms of exercise usually result in some form of repetitive strain injury. They can also be really boring, and your post-exercise calorie burn starts to dip off after about 6 hours. When you combine weight training and cardio training, that is where you find the best weight loss formula. Strength training has a higher post-exercise oxygen demand. This means that after doing a good strength training session, your muscles require a lot more oxygen and other fuel sources in order to recover from the workout. This increased oxygen consumption, or excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), requires a ton of energy - or calories. So if you combine some quality cardio, with a well-designed strength training program, you will not only be burning tons of calories during your workout, but you’ll also be burning calories for up to 36 hours post-exercise! That sounds like a recipe for weight-loss success to me!

<em>Side Note: Muscles are metabolically expensive so the more muscle you have, the higher your basal metabolic rate - ie. the calories you burn while sitting on the couch, sleeping, hanging out.</em><strong>Protein Powder Makes You Gain Weight/ Creatine Makes You Retain Water </strong>

This myth ends up really limiting people from some amazing supplements that can really take their training to the next level. What is important with these supplements is knowing what kind to choose. Some protein powders are designed to help people build mass. These protein powders will have a higher carbohydrate content, and be higher in calories. If you want a protein that will support muscle recovery but not gain unwanted weight, reach for one that is lower in calorie, has 20g-30g of protein, and less than 5g of carbohydrates per servings. Creatine is an excellent supplement to help you train harder. Creatine is one of the fuel sources used in our explosive-energy system, or the ATP-CP system. Therefore supplementing this gives you more fuel for your lifts. Creatine does help the cells retain water, and so people who supplement with creatine may find that their weight increases from increased water retention. So as a consumer, it is important for you to decide if you’re willing to give a little to get a lot of strength gains. When reaching for a creatine supplement, creatine monohydrate is the way to go. It is usually less expensive AND it has been shown to be more bioavailable.

<strong>Core is the Key to Flat Stomach</strong>

Our bodies hold onto weight around our middle because fat is an excellent shock absorber. All of our vital organs are in our torso, with the exception of a few glands in the throat, and our brain (duh). So our bodies, being the wonderfully evolved entities that they are, will put on more weight in our middle area to help insulate and cushion our vital organs. Therefore losing the weight around the middle cannot simply be achieved by doing a bunch of crunches. The saying “abs are made in the kitchen” is actually pretty accurate. In order to lose the visceral fat around our middle, we need to eat in such a way that the body does not store any of our food as fat. We also need to be training hard enough that our body wants to shed unnecessary weight so that doing those push-ups and squats are a little bit easier.

These really are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to fitness myths. We hope that this has cleared up a few fitness myths for you. If you ever come across a new fitness trend, or hear something about a supplement or diet, make sure you do your research and ensure that it is actually right and healthy for you! Let us know what other myths you’d like de-bunked!

14,Go nuts for nut (and seed) butters,https://freeformfitness.ca/go-nuts-nut-seed-butters/,"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:11:14 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7381,"It can be smooth, and it can be crunchy. It can be whipped, all natural, and even pre-mixed with honey! What is this versatile spread that we have come to love? Well it is the one, the only, peanut butter! What was once just the PB of the PB &amp; J sandwich has evolved into a fitness food that comes in so many different varieties the even people with peanut allergies have the opportunity to pick from a variety other nut and soy butters to spread on their plain rice cakes. With so many options out there and all of the different ways we can use nut butters to reach our fitness goals, we thought it would be fun to give you a few quick facts about highly nutritious fitness food!

<strong>Not All Peanut Butters Are Made the Same</strong>

If you go down the breakfast aisle in most grocery stores you’ll see that there isn’t just the classic kraft smooth or crunchy peanut butter jars on offer. They’ve now added whipped, all natural, and pre-mixed varieties like honey and peanut butter! Leave that aisle and head to the healthy/organic section and you’ll get even more nut butter varieties like almond, cashew, and soy butters. So which one should you go for? Well if you are looking for a peanut butter that likely still has many of the benefits of peanuts, your safest bet is to go for an organic, all natural peanut butter. Yes - this means you’ll have to do a little extra work to mix the separated oil with the nut butter, but a little bit of work provides you with way more health benefits than simply reaching for the other stuff. The fewer the ingredients on the label, the better!

<strong>The Benefits of Peanuts </strong>

If you’re going to go for the slightly more expensive, labour intensive, all natural peanut butter, there better be some really great benefits to it? Well nutritionally, the closer the nut butter is to peanuts, the better! Just look at these impressive nutrition facts for just 100g of peanuts:

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/peanuts.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7383"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/peanuts.jpg"" alt="""" width=""367"" height=""296"" /></a>

It has been cited that because of peanut’s high nutritional value, that they are used as a complete dietary source on arctic expeditions! The monounsaturated fat in peanuts has actually been shown to reduce the bad cholesterol (LDL) in the body by 14%, while maintaining healthy levels of HDL, the good cholesterol and reducing triglycerides in the blood. Peanuts also contain all 20 amino acids required by the human body!

Just look at the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4711439/table/Tab2/"">protein punch</a> that peanuts pack compared to other plant-based protein sources: With such awesome nutritional value, it only makes sense to get the most out of your peanut butter by going for the organic, all natural variety.

Peanut allergies are listed as one of the top allergies in Canada so here are the alternative options for those of you with peanut allergies who are looking for a healthy spread to add to their fitness food repertoire!

<strong>Almond Butter:​</strong> Almonds and almond butters are a great source of protein (7g per 1 cup), and offer more omega-6 fatty acids than peanuts! They are also lower in calories, and are the most nutrient dense nut on the market!

<strong>Soy Butter:</strong> ​Soy butters actually provide you with more protein than peanut butter (10g), and are a great way to get your omega-3’s!

<strong>Pumpkin Seed butter:</strong> ​Can’t do nut spreads at all? Pumpkin seed butter is a great alternative as it has more protein than peanut butter (10g), and boasts a number of other health benefits like it’s high fiber, potassium, and beta-carotene concentration.

<strong>Go Nuts with Nut (and seed) Butters!</strong>

You now know just how awesome adding nut and seed butters to your diet can be! Whether you’re looking for an energy rich spread, or something to add a little more protein and healthy fats to your day, including a nut and seed butter can be a great way to accomplish this.",,7381,2018-02-26 10:11:14,2018-02-26 15:11:14,closed,open,go-nuts-nut-seed-butters,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,_thumbnail_id,7386,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,shared_counts,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,shared_counts_datetime,1595260463,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of you may not even notice the music that plays at all of our locations, but for those of you that do, have you ever noticed how it affects your workout? Maybe the steady beat of Cola has helped you push through those last few squats, or maybe hearing the chorus of Despacito has caused you to slam those battle ropes just a little bit harder in a pure and unfettered rage. Music is one of the most impressive human creations and has long been studied for its effect on the human brain. This week we are going to explain to you exactly how music affects us, and how we can use it to take our workouts to the next level!

<strong>Your Brain on Music</strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/brain.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7586 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/brain.jpg"" alt="""" width=""323"" height=""184"" /></a>

The <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21658819"">surge in activity</a> in the brain when we listen to music is incredible! Music has proven to be a powerful tool in individuals with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zo_JQZo3Y0"">alzheimer’s and dementia</a>, allowing them to access memories from their past and regain some understanding of where they are. People who <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_2nTL26wxU"">stutter </a>are able to speak without hesitation or difficulty when they sing a song from memory.

This is possible because music affects various areas in the brain, and is not exclusive to the speech or auditory areas. In the image above you can see that music affects our hippocampus, or the area in the brain that is involved with our memory. So for the individuals who stutter, this is why they can sing without stammering. Their brain draws on memories in order to form the sentences, instead of the language centers. This also links music to experiences, which is why patients with alzheimer's and dementia can play music they played pre-diagnosis, and why listening to certain pieces of music can be incredibly emotional for them as it brings back old memories that they thought they’d lost forever. Music also influences the motor cortex. This is why you may find yourself unconsciously tapping your foot, or bobbing your head to certain songs. Your body has a physical reaction to music that attempts to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28257971"">sync the body</a> up to the rhythm of the music. Music and Athletes All of these amazing ways that music affects the brain are great, but how does it relate to people exercising and our actual performance? Well there have been studies (1, 2, 3) on both endurance and power athletes on how music can improve (or diminish) their training and performance. To simplify the studies, in endurance athletes, the studies show that individuals who ran to a music they 1. Liked and 2. Corresponded to a certain BPM allowed them to regulate their heart rate faster while training, and improved their running time. For the power athletes, because their events are much shorter than any duration of song, music had a psychological effect on them prior to competing. Listening to (again) a song they knew and enjoyed improved their pre-competition mental state.

<strong>The “Perfect” Motivational Music</strong>

We all have varying tastes in music, and therefore it is difficult to say that there is one type of music that will improve our overall ability to train. The studies did show that enjoying the music that was being played was a factor in how well the music was able to improve their overall performance. If you are having a hard time choosing the best music to workout to, then science has found an ideal choice for you! When we listen to music, our breathing and heart rate can be affected. What scientists have discovered is that if you are training for an extended period of time, finding music that is <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/10/health/10iht-fitness.1.9126209.html"">120 to 140 beats</a> per minute can help decrease your rate of perceived exertion, and allow you to train harder and longer. This is because when the body synchronizes our breathing and heart rate to this rhythm, we are able to maintain our exercise intensity for much longer. So what does 120-140 beats per minute sound like? Most dance and electronic songs are produced at 120-140 beats per minute. Classical music also produces some pieces at this beat rate. <a href=""https://jog.fm/workout-songs?bpm=134"">Here</a> is a fairly comprehensive list of other songs like Jessie’s Girl, and Coldest Winter by Kanye that meet this criteria.

Music really is an incredible part of the human experience so it comes as no surprise that it can also be used to amplify our experience in the gym. Let us know in the comments what kind of music helps you get your moving in the gym!

16,Ketogenic Diet,https://freeformfitness.ca/ketogenic-diet/,"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 18:07:20 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7599,"The latest in diet “fads” is the ketogenic diet. What is this diet that seems to be working so well for so many people? What about ketones? Aren’t they bad for us? What is an exogenous ketone? How do I get into ketosis? These are just some of the questions that we get a lot of at Free Form so we figured it was about time we take the frequently asked questions about ketosis.

<strong>What is Ketosis?</strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/keto1.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7600 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/keto1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""324"" height=""169"" /></a>

Ketosis is not some new state that we have created with the ketogenic diet. Ketosis is actually a very normal metabolic process that occurs in the body. When our body doesn’t have enough carbohydrates to perform its daily tasks, or to workout, the body burns fat instead. In the process of breaking down the fat for energy, the body creates ketones as a byproduct.

<strong>How do I get into Ketosis?</strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/keto2.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7601 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/keto2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""262"" height=""197"" /></a>

In order to get into a state of ketosis, your blood needs to reach a certain concentration of ketones. For the optimal ketogenic diet state, you want to be between 2 - 7 milli-moles. You can test this in a variety of ways. There are keto-strips, which are an inexpensive way to test if you are in ketosis. You can find them on amazon for around $15. The only thing with these strips is that as your body maintains elevated ketone levels, the strips no longer read them. So if you are constantly testing, you may get a negative reading and think you’re out of ketosis, but really you’ve just stopped peeing them out. The best way to continuously test your ketone levels is with a breath ketone device like Levl but because this is a device that comes with a few more bells and whistles, it will cost you $700 USD.

<b>What does a typical Ketogenic diet look like?</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/keto3.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7602 alignnone"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/keto3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""613"" height=""342"" /></a>

In order to get into ketosis you need to cut down your carbohydrate intake and up your fat and protein intake. Carbohydrate recommendations are typically under 50g/day. This is what makes this diet tricky for some people because the average North American eats 200-300grams of carbs a day! Healthy fats are a huge part of this diet, obviously, as fats are becoming your main fuel source. Remember - fat does not make you fat. You want to be picking really good, healthy fats, like avocados, nuts, full-fat creams and cream cheeses.

There are a number of instagram accounts, blogs, and youtube channels that do a great job of explaining the ketogenic diet, and provide recipes and tips for you to make the most of your ketogenic diet. Here are just a few of our recommendations:

In this cited review, they list a number of health benefits associated with a ketogenic diet. They are:
- Weight management/weight loss
- Managing insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes
- Reducing the frequency of seizures in individuals with epilepsy
- Controlling acne
- Reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease
- Slowing the progression of some types of cancer (still in early stages of research)
- Managing PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) symptoms
- Potential therapeutic use for neurological disorders and diseases like Alzheimer’s,
headaches, Parkinson’s, sleep disorders, MS, autism, and brain cancer (again - these
are all in their early stages of research).

<strong>Is a Ketogenic diet Dangerous? (What is Ketoacidosis)
</strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening condition that type 1 diabetics are at risk of when too many ketones build up in the blood. As a diabetic, their body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot shuttle glucose into the cells. When an individual with diabetes cannot get insulin, the body is not using carbohydrates for fuel, so it switches to the ketone-producing pathway. The ketones then build up in the blood and, if not caught early, the build up becomes acidic and then leads to keto-acidosis. This can be treated with high-electrolyte fluids and insulin. Individuals with type 1 diabetes should talk to a physician before considering any dietary changes.

For those of us who are not diabetic, our bodies will not get into this keto-acidodic state because we can produce insulin. Therefore the blood cannot reach high enough levels of ketones to become acidic.

17,Compound Movements 101: The Squat,https://freeformfitness.ca/compound-movements-101-the-squat/,"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 13:45:23 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7616,"This week’s topic - the squat. Knowing how to properly squat is crucial to long-term health and physical independence as we get older. So what is the right way to squat? Should we all strive for toes and legs pointed forward, or is a wider stance right for everyone? Read on to find out to the answer!

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Squatting really is one of the best compound exercise you can do when you workout. The set up alone helps to improve our posture by teaching us to set the shoulder back, engage our core, and align the knees over the toes. We have to wake up those glutes we’ve been sitting on all day and ask all of those large-and-in-charge muscles in our legs to bring us safely to the floor - and stand us right back up. This is why having proper technique is so important because that will carry us through life in more ways than just helping us sit down and stand back up properly.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image3.gif""><img class=""wp-image-7619 aligncenter"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image3.gif"" alt="""" width=""342"" height=""249"" /></a>

So what do you really need to care about when you squat? That’s a tricky question to answer, but for this article we are going to focus on where the weight is with respect to the muscles you want to work. Place it perfectly and you get a beautiful blend of quad and glute activation. Place it poorly and you risk feeling all the weight in your back. Instead of being afraid of the latter and missing out on an awesome exercise, we should strive to hit that perfect form.

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/L9XRA_s-200x150.gif""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7617 aligncenter"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/L9XRA_s-200x150.gif"" alt="""" width=""200"" height=""150"" /></a>

Accomplishing the perfect positioning in the squat is dependent on a few things: femur length relative to torso and shin length, where the weight is, and how good your ankle mobility is. The easiest way to tie these all together is to get the weight lined up over the middle of the foot. How you get the weight there will be completely unique to your individual anatomy. When I cue a client to squat for the first time, I get them to start with feet hip width apart, and toes slightly pointed outwards. The next step is getting the shoulders over the middle of the foot. We accomplish this by tipping forward and pushing the hips back *slightly*. Once they’ve done this, it is now time to sit down. This is where we start to see the difference in people’s squat mechanics.

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If the hip-width-toes-pointed-forward position is right for them, they will be able to maintain the shoulders over the middle of the foot, and the chest upright. If their torso dips over, and the shoulders move beyond the toes, then it is time to widen that stance. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/squat.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-7618 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/squat.jpg"" alt="""" width=""462"" height=""317"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yes - opening up the stance and pointing out the toes will require greater activation of the adductor, or inner thigh, muscles, so it is important to make sure the client is not allowing the knees to fall in. This can be corrected by either adding a band around the lower thigh above the knee. If you don’t have a band, try “splitting the floor in half” with your feet. You obviously will not be able to actually split the floor in half, but attempting this will turn on your ABductors, or your outer thigh muscles, which will create a more balanced contraction throughout legs. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Getting the squat just right takes time, practice, and a good coach to see all of the things you may not be able to see when you are squatting. There are a number of videos out there explaining proper squat mechanics, squat warm-ups, and mobility drills to get a better squat. Here are just a few of those and we encourage you to check these out.</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fob2wWEC72s""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fob2wWEC72s</span></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBHzXF-mVjY""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBHzXF-mVjY</span></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gwgm3s2EQ0""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gwgm3s2EQ0</span></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yFbBWTB8y0""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yFbBWTB8y0</span></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUdx8C7mDSM""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUdx8C7mDSM</span></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2b8UdqmlFs""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2b8UdqmlFs</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Take the time with your Free Form trainer to work on the squat and get the most out of this amazing exercise.</span>",,7616,2018-03-20 09:45:23,2018-03-20 13:45:23,closed,open,compound-movements-101-the-squat,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,personal-trainer-articles,Personal Trainer Articles,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,25,_thumbnail_id,7619,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595265341,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,Hack Motivation to Set Better Goals,https://freeformfitness.ca/hack-motivation-to-set-better-goals/,"Tue, 27 Mar 2018 13:22:06 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7630,"Setting goals is a crucial part of life. It is one of our first questions when a new client walks in the door - “So what are your goals?” and that’s because without those goals there is no map for us to follow. But have you ever wondered why some goals are easier to reach than others? This is because the motivation that keeps us working towards those goals is more complex than simply reading motivational quotes or listening to a good piece of music. Based on Daniel H. Pink’s book, <a href=""https://www.amazon.ca/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1521994169&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=drive+daniel+h+pink"">Drive,</a> there are 3 forms of motivation - intrinsic, extrinsic, and the biological motivators. In order to set really good goals and ensure you are well equipped to meet those goals it is important to consider all three forms of motivation.

<strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7631"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""652"" height=""217"" /></a>
Intrinsic Motivation
</strong><a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/browse/intrinsic-motivation"">Dictionary.com</a> defines intrinsic motivation as “the undertaking of an activity, as a hobby, without external incentive; also personal satisfaction derived through self-initiated achievement”. In sports it has been <a href=""https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/Citation/1987/00150/12_Intrinsic_Motivation_in_Sport.15.aspx"">cited</a> that the intrinsic motivations - ie. experiencing self-improvement in the sport and general enjoyment - are far more valued to amateur athletes than the extrinsic motivations. Finding the personal motivations to do something can be the difference of failing and succeeding when we are setting goals in every aspect of our lives. Is it your goal to start a
training program this year and stick to it? Ask yourself why - then ask why again. Dig deep until you find the motivation that matters to you and does not have a tangible reward, or a reward that is dependant on others.

It’s easy to find the extrinsic motivators out there because we can see and hear them all around us. Whether it is looking a certain way, earning a medal, or getting praise from your boss, these are things that we can experience every day. Intrinsic motivators are what we experience on our own and really drive passion in the gym, work place, and in our everyday lives. It is these goals that feed our need to master tasks, become more autonomous, and give us purpose in life.

<strong>Extrinsic Motivation</strong>

Intrinsic motivations are great, but as we said earlier, it is important to have all forms of motivation in a healthy balance. Extrinsic motivators are great for giving yourself that little extra push when you are struggling to stick to your goals. These are things like earning that pay raise at work, winning a medal in a competition, or even getting recognition from friends and family are all forms of extrinsic motivation that work in a pinch.

Find these motivators early on are great for igniting that passion and mindset to make a change in your life. Make these motivations visible, either by writing them down or creating things like a vision board in a space that you see every day to keep them in mind.

<strong>Biological Motivation</strong>

The final major motivator to think about when we are setting goals are our biological needs. Ever heard of Maslow’s Hierarchy of needs? In 1943, Abraham Maslow presented the basic human needs in a pyramid diagram. At the top of the pyramid, you can see our intrinsic motivators, the middle comprises those extrinsic motivators, and at the bottom, the most basic of our needs are listed. It is these basic needs that we should also consider when we are making goals. How will our goals better serve our basic needs? How can a new exercise regime, for example, better serve our basic needs? How can a new exercise regime, for example, better serve your basic needs?

</strong>
To conclude this week’s blog, it is important to mention S.M.A.R.T. goal setting. This is a practice that is taught in many coaching and counselling courses. The acronym stands for specific, measurable, actionable, realistic and time sensitive/time frame. When you set goals, make sure they are specific. The more specific the goal, the clearer the target. Measurable relates how you will measure the success of this goal. If it is a weight loss/weight gain goal, this would be the number on the scale or the body-fat percentage you are aiming for. Actionable and realistic are likely the most important parts of S.M.A.R.T. goal setting. What are the actions you will take to reach this goal, and is it realistic to your life. This is where the various motivations we have talked about in this article come into play. Think about what truly motivates you and how you can use that information to take specific steps to reach your goal. Does the goal also seem realistic with respect to what truly motivates you in life. Lastly is the time frame. You can take 2 weeks or you can take a lifetime. Giving yourself a time frame is important to keep your focused and to keep your gaze on the horizon.

As a final note, here is the famous TED talk by Daniel H. Pink, which quickly summarizes many of the points made in this post. Try setting some new goals, or re-assessing old goals using the 3 forms of motivation. Let us know how it goes in the comments!

19,Here Comes The Sun,https://freeformfitness.ca/here-comes-the-sun/,"Mon, 02 Apr 2018 15:20:00 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7638,"<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pug.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7639 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pug.jpg"" alt="""" width=""206"" height=""222"" /></a>With the passing of March 21st, it is official - Spring is here! The temperatures are slowly going to start to rise, the flowers will begin to bloom, and we are finally coming out of months of darkness. The days are longer, and if you catch yourself in a space that is protected from the wind, you may have already begun to feel the Sun’s warmth. Did you know that exposure to natural sunlight has more benefits than thawing us out in the summer? In the spirit of spring, this week we want to shed a little light on the benefits, and risks, of sun exposure.

<strong>The Benefits</strong>
Vitamin D has quickly become one of the best known benefits of the Sun - and rightly so! Getting 30 minutes of natural sunlight yields 50,000 IU’s of vitamin D a day in light skin toned individuals, 20,000 - 30,000 IU’s in tanned skin individuals, and 8,000 - 10,000 IU in dark skin toned individuals. The vitamin D we consume in supplement form most commonly comes in doses of 2,000 to 10,000 IU’s a day.<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/benefits.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7640 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/benefits.jpg"" alt="""" width=""243"" height=""155"" /></a>

When we produce <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/"">vitamin D</a> through the photosynthetic process (using the sun to synthesize the vitamin), it produces Vitamin
D3. Vitamin D3 then circulates the blood and goes through a number of transformations in places like the liver and kidneys. What is really interesting is that when it is transformed in the kidneys, it becomes 1,25(OH)D, which is actually a hormone! Hormones, as we all know, are incredibly powerful chemicals in the human body that control mood, metabolism, and our reproductive cycles! In the case of 1,25(OH)D, this form of vitamin D is in charge of the calcium and phosphorus concentrations in the blood and can make or break the bones in the body! In fact, children who do not produce or consume enough vitamin D can develop a disease known as rickets, which causes malformation in the bones and stunts growth. As we get older is it important for us to have sufficient levels of vitamin D circulating in our systems to prevent the onset of conditions like osteoporosis.

Beyond the bones, there are also vitamin D receptors in the brain, as it plays a role in the production of certain neurotransmitters and hormones. This is why <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5610883/"">vitamin D</a> has been shown to boost the mood of individuals, and likely why we are all just a little bit less irritable when summertime is here.

Furthermore, according to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5592328/"">a paper </a>published in the Cardiovascular Journal of Africa, they have found multiple research studies that suggest vitamin D deficiency increases our predisposition to 17 types of cancer, heart disease, autoimmune disease and several other conditions. Beyond the production of vitamin D, which is produced via the UVB radiation, UVA radiation helps to mobilize the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5592328/"">nitric oxide</a> in the body, which can help to open up the blood vessels and improve circulation in the body, which is a warm welcome to individuals with cardiovascular conditions.

Lastly, some new research is suggesting that not getting enough sunlight could be related to the development of multiple sclerosis, metabolic syndrome, and Alzheimers and dementia. You can find a more detailed description of how UVB radiation has been linked to these condition in this review, published in the Journal of Dermatoendocinology.

<strong>The Risks</strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sun.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-7641 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sun.jpg"" alt="""" width=""267"" height=""365"" /></a>All of those benefits sound great, but what about all of the information we have on how sunlight and UV radiation is linked to skin cancers like melanoma? Although the sun brings energy and many health benefits to us, the ultraviolet radiation penetrates the skin and has the ability to alter our cells. This is where our common theme of moderation, and knowing your personal limitations, can really be useful. UV radiation is often <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129901/"">cited</a> as a cause of melanoma, but in some of the literature linked before, it was also linked as a something that need to prevent melanoma. The devil is really in the details with this one. Non-burning UV radiation is linked to preventing cancers like melanoma, while sunburns are known to double your risk of developing melanoma. And yes, a tan is actually a sign that your skin has begun to burn, so just be careful with how quickly you get your tan on this summer.

Melanoma is a cancer that is heavily tied to genetic predisposition, so if this is a form of cancer that runs in the family, extra caution is advised when going out in the sun.

<strong>In Conclusion</strong>
Our ancestors lived under the sun for thousands of years and therefore evolved with it. We should respect this fact and do our best to feed our bodies the sunshine they need to function optimally. We should also take advantage of the advancements in modern science and respect the fact that getting a sunburn is what we need to protect ourselves from. This means striking a balance between getting enough sunscreen-free sunlight, and knowing when it is time lather on some sunscreen.

20,Fitness Competition Questions - Answered! Part 1,https://freeformfitness.ca/fitness-com-questions-answered/,"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 19:47:42 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7699,"If you are in the fitness industry as either a trainer or are a fitness enthusiast, you’ve definitely heard of, have seen, or have participated in a fitness competition. Tanned, glossy men and women strutting their stuff on stage in swimsuits and bikinis, looking like chiselled out Greek sculptures. These competitions are hard core and inspire many of us to set those physiques presented on stage as a goal for ourselves. So what does it really take to be stage ready? This week we want to give you an insider look into what it takes to participate in a fitness competition from the perspective of our very own Lindsay Blue, COO of Free Form Fitness.

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_3931.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7671"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_3931.jpg"" alt="""" width=""750"" height=""708"" /></a><em>R in the following section is for Riley, our main contributor to the FFF blog. L corresponds to the answers provided by Lindsay Blue.</em><strong>R: What was your initial motivation to participate in a fitness competition?
</strong>
L: Because I never thought I could - and I don’t like feeling like I cannot do something. That was my initial reason, but it turns out I really loved the process - now I do it to keep myself on track and accountable to my nutrition and exercise.

<strong>R: How much did you know about the process prior to signing up?
</strong>
L: Nothing - absolutely nothing.

<strong>R: Did you do research before signing up? Or did you sign up and learn as the process unfolded?
</strong>
L: I signed up first and learned what I needed throughout the process and from my then-coach Tess Franklin (Albert St. Manager), who had competed a couple of times before me.

<strong>R: What doesn’t the research tell you?
</strong>
L: How tough it will be mentally. It is very time consuming, and mentally and physically draining. And each time you prep, your body responds differently, what worked before, may not work again. You may have to switch up your approach many times throughout prep.

<strong>R: How long was your first prep?
</strong>
L: Beginning of March to Mid June.

<strong>R: How many times have you competed?
</strong>
L: 5 times total - 4 in bikini, 1 in figure.

<strong>R: Does it get easier or harder the more you do?</strong>

L: A bit of both actually - because you have done it before, you know what to expect. But because you know what to expect, there are aspects that you dread, lol.

<strong>R: What was the hardest part of prep?
</strong>
L: Staying on track with the uber strict nutrition and, towards the end of prep, fitting in all the cardio and workouts while maintaining a full time job and a home life.

<strong>R: What was the best part of prep?</strong>

L: Watching the progress (gains) you make and as the fat melts away, watching that hard earned muscle appear from underneath.

<strong>R: What was the most unexpected part of your prep?</strong>

L: How much I was going to love it.

<strong>R: What does a typical prep diet look like?</strong>

L: VERY CLEAN - no processed sugars, foods, alcohol, simple carbs etc. Stick to the primal foods - meat, veg, and complex carbs cooked as naturally/cleanly as possible. You only begin removing calories and macros as your body plateaus. As long as your body is responding and you are continually leaning out, keep as much food in your diet as you can. It does drop quite significantly very shortly out from your show.

<strong>R: How did your training change throughout the process? After the process?</strong>

L: Training changes slightly from prep to off season bulking - but I let the experts figure that out for me! And I follow their plan. We take the judges feedback from each show and adjust the focus as we go.

<strong>R: Is a coach necessary? (posing, nutrition, workouts, etc.)</strong>

L: I think so. Even having done multiple shows, with multiple coaches and trainers, and working in the industry, I still have a coach. Somebody who knows the process, can work with your body as it plateaus and needs changes made, and to give you a fresh, external perspective. But even if you want to try the workout and nutrition on your own - at very least - get a posing coach so you are prepared for stage and present your hard work in the most flattering way you can! You do NOT put in all this hard work to tank your presentation on stage and not place where you should!

<strong>R: Who do you think competitions are best suited for? Is there anyone you would caution against taking part in this process?</strong>

L: To be honest, anybody with poor body image, eating disorders etc. this process can wreak havoc on them. It is a very subjective sport where you are getting up on stage in front of a LOT of people in very little clothing and having them analyze your body and critique it, compare it against all the others up there with you. However, if this is a goal to challenge yourself or a bucket list item - give it all you got!

<strong>R: If you could give 1 piece of advice to someone considering the process, what would it be?</strong>

L: If you are going to commit to a competition - give it your all so when you walk across that stage, you strut with pride and confidence, showing off all your hard work knowing you gave it your all and did all you could to make it there.

<strong>R: Could you summarize the process in 1 quick statement/sentence?</strong>

L: Challenge yourself - “If we are not a little bit uncomfortable every day, we’re not growing. All the good stuff is outside our comfort zone.” - Jack Canfield “Once in a while, blow your own damn mind” - unknown

Many of our trainers have competed in these fitness competitions and each bring their own perspective and experiences to the sport, so if you wish to find out more about this level of training, or you have your own comments and experiences to share, send us an e-mail! We’d love to hear from you!

22,Why you should take a squat break,https://freeformfitness.ca/why-you-should-take-a-squat-break/,"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 18:36:50 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7713,"Most of you have probably heard that sitting at a desk all day is really bad for posture. With the recent introduction of standing desks, society is starting to catch up with the data and is looking for solutions to this issue. Unfortunately implementing standing desks isn’t addressing the real issue here, so we are still seeing people complain of low back pain, inactive glutes, and a myriad of other troubles. So what really is the problem here and how can we fix it? Well we want to propose to you a potential solution for your posture problems, and help you avoid things like chronic back pain and “sleepy glutes”.

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sleepy.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7714"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sleepy.jpg"" alt="""" width=""510"" height=""204"" /></a><strong>Sleepy Glutes
</strong>
When we are sitting all day long, our glutes are lengthened. Essentially what desk jobs do is keep the glutes in a static stretch for 8 hours. When the muscles are lengthened like this for an extended period of time, the contractile elements of the muscles become weakened. The nervous system is not sending contraction messages the glutes, and therefore it focuses its energy on other muscles that are being contracted more frequently - like the hip flexors. This is another common symptom of desk work is that our hip flexors - long muscles that extend from our thigh bone to the back bones - are incredibly tight and over active. The flexion may be passive, but it is similar to holding a wall sit or a plank for 8 hours. Imagine how strong your core would be if the brain got really good at holding a plank! What this muscle imbalance does is pull the pelvis into an anterior tilt.

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/glutes.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7715"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/glutes.jpg"" alt="""" width=""420"" height=""190"" /></a><strong>Welcome to the Chronic Low Back Pain Club</strong>

When our pelvis is pulled into the anterior pelvic tilt, it pinches the low back. You may have heard form one of your Free Form trainers that there is always one side stronger than the other. These bilateral imbalances are very common, but this causes even more trouble in the case of chronic low back pain. As the pelvis tilts forward, one hip flexor will be stronger than the next. So not only do we have an anterior tilt, but one half of the pelvis (the pelvis is made of 2 bones stuck together by cartilage) is being tugged on more than the other. This pulling shifts the sacrum of the spine out of place in the pelvis, and so we get bones rubbing together. So now not only do we have pinched vertebrae, but we also have bones rubbing together that should only ever glide along each other through the natural movements of the body.

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pain.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7716"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pain.jpg"" alt="""" width=""433"" height=""240"" /></a><strong>So now what?

</strong>Okay so now you have a basic understanding of how sitting all day long can cause low back pain. So what about the standing desks? Well although standing desks do get us out of the 8- hour glute stretch - who can really say they hold perfect posture for the whole work day? I am sure some of you with standing desks have noticed that as the day goes on, you find yourself leaning on your desk. The standing desk is certainly an improvement because you have room to move while working, but it can also exacerbate some of the postural issues that you already have. So what can you do?

<strong>Drop it like a Squat
</strong>
There are a number of great exercises to lengthen the hip flexors, get the glutes engaged and stretch out the low back. At the bottom of this blog post you can find a few exercises and further information about strengthening the glutes, lengthening the hip flexors, and improving overall posture. For now though, we present the case for a regular squat break at work. Getting up every 1 to 2 hours and doing 10-15 bodyweight squats is a great way to keep your glutes alert, lubricate the joints in the hip, knees, ankles, and low back. It also promotes venous return of blood that may have begun to pool in the feet and ankles after being seated for so long. A proper squat, meaning every element is given the attention it deserves, also recruits the core musculature and reminds the brain that muscles like your glutes, your quads, and your calves need some attention too.

Going to work is an imperative of life, but bad posture and chronic pain doesn’t have to be. Get up and take a squat break and take notice of how it changes the way you feel at work.

23,Are you breathing properly?,https://freeformfitness.ca/are-you-breathing-properly/,"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 15:04:34 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7744,"This title of this blog may seem confusing, at first. How can you breathe properly? Isn’t it just inhale and exhale and voila! - we are breathing(?) Technically yes, that is the general gist of breathing. How do you breathe is really what we are trying to emphasize here. Sit back wherever you are, close your eyes and take a few deep breaths in and out. Pay attention to the way that you are breathing. Does you chest rise and fall? Do you feel yourself getting more relaxed? How about your belly or low back? Do you sense any movement there? No? Well then - physiologically - you are not breathing properly.

<strong>Stressful Breathing</strong>

In a number of our previous blogs, we have mentioned the importance of proper breathing technique. It is important when we are lifting in the gym, and it is also a valuable tool for reducing stress in our lives. Many of us, though, are actually causing more stress responses in our body because of the way we breathe. The rising and falling of our chest - feeling the ribs expand up into the collar bone, even sometimes seeing our shoulders shrug slightly, is a secondary mechanism for breathing. This uses much smaller muscles like the intercostals (muscles between the ribs), and the muscles of the chest and neck to create space in the rib cage area in order to let the lungs expand. Although this does enable the lungs to expand and therefore take in more oxygen, it does not even come close to how efficient the diaphragm (our primary breathing muscle), is at facilitating breathing.

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/LmY5p.gif""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7745"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/LmY5p.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""282"" /></a>

So how is that causing us stress? Have you ever been stressed and experienced hyperventilating? Short, shallow breaths, are used to pull in any oxygen we can when we are hyperventilating in order to get just enough oxygen to the body. When we breathe into our chest, we mimic the hyperventilating breaths. Your body understands small, shallow breaths as a response to stress and therefore releases cortisol to help you battle or flee from the threat. This constant hum of cortisol can actually be very damaging to the body as it increases inflammation, and damages the lining of blood vessels and airways.

Don’t believe us? Watch the way a baby or a pet breathes. Watch as their stomachs and low back expand and collapse with every breath. Animals and babies rarely recruit their secondary breathing musculature as it is an inefficient way to bring oxygen into the body.

<strong>Belly Breathing</strong>

So how are babies and animals breathing into their bellies and not their chest? They, by way of having been barely influenced by modern-day media, are not self-conscious about expand their stomachs. They still have a connection to their diaphragm and it is therefore used at the primary respiratory muscle.

If we look at the trunk of the body between the bottom of the rib cage and the pelvis area it is lined with a number of interwoven muscles that are most commonly known as the core muscles. The diaphragm, which is a dome-like muscle sits at along the inferior borders of the rib cage and act as the ceiling of the core. The pelvic floor, or the muscles that line the bottom of the pelvis, are the base of the core. The abs, transverse abdominals, the spinal muscles, obliques, and the quadratus lumborum are the walls of this structure. This interwoven combination of muscles with fibers running in all different directions are what give our torso rigidity in an area where the only major bones are the vertebrae that connect the ribs and the pelvis. This is why when we breathe right, our stomachs and lower back expand. By pulling the diaphragm down into the core area (as seen to in the image to the right), this highly pressurized area needs to expand in order to handle the displaced area caused by the contracting diaphragm. It does this by stretching out the muscles around the middle.

<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/breathing.gif""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7747"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/breathing.gif"" alt="""" width=""480"" height=""270"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When our diaphragm is pulled down into the stomach, this also creates more space in the thoracic cavity - the area enclosed by the rib cage. Quick physics lesson - when we increase the volume of a container, we create an area of low concentration. Air moves from areas of high concentration to low concentration. So the space we create in the thoracic cavity when we use our diaphragm creates a significant change in pressure and concentration in the lungs, allowing oxygen to flow into the lungs. You can see in the image below that the diaphragm is a much larger muscle with greater contractile potential than the intercostals.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lungs.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-7746"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lungs-1024x382.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""382"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Take a breath.

24,Supplement Spotlight: Caffeine,https://freeformfitness.ca/supplement-spotlight-caffeine/,"Tue, 08 May 2018 13:15:55 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7755,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Caffeine is one of the most well researched and effective ergogenic aids for sports and exercise. When people think of performance enhancement they likely think of steroids, doping, and fancy tools like hyperbaric chambers. For the everyday person who simply needs a boost in their workouts, these expensive and damaging options are not so readily available.

</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How much do we need in order to reap the rewards of this natural performance booster? Many research shows that ~3mg/kg of body mass is sufficient. Some </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23834545""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">studies </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">had participants take upwards of 5mg/kg of body mass and saw a significant increase in the participant’s max reps. Caffeine supplements are an option but there are many other ways to get your caffeine fix.  Below is a list of foods and beverages with some of the highest amounts of caffeine that are available to all of us on a regular basis.</span><b>Venti Starbucks Blonde Roast: 475mg

Just one cup of coffee can take around 15 minutes for its effects to be felt and these can last up to 6 hours. For this reason, individuals who are consuming large quantities of caffeine a day, or are consuming caffeine late into the evening can experience some issues sleeping. Caffeine is also mildly addictive, hence why pop producers use in it their beverages. Some individuals have reported feeling jittery and anxious after consuming a caffeinated substance and this is because it stimulates the central nervous system. It is so effective at doing this that if consumed in too large of a quantity for an individual who is sensitive to the drug, then the central nervous system becomes </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">too</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> active for that individual process. Some people also find that after consuming a caffeinated beverage or food that they experience some gastrointestinal issues like frequent and uncomfortable trips to the bathroom. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the end it all comes down to a classic fitness and health principle - everything in moderation. Use this information to implement caffeine into your training and daily life and see how, and what, works for you. No two bodies will react exactly the same to a substance like caffeine. Let us know how you get your caffeine fix, or why you choose not to! </span>",,7755,2018-05-08 09:15:55,2018-05-08 13:15:55,closed,open,supplement-spotlight-caffeine,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,personal-trainer-articles,Personal Trainer Articles,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,7756,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,25,xyz_fbap,1,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595281812,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Except it isn’t only benefiting you, now it is benefiting the baby too! In fact, there are some new theories suggesting that early pregnancy can have similar effects as some performance enhancing techniques. These theories are actually not that new, though, as there are some who say that during the Cold War, the Russian’s would get their female athletes pregnant and terminate the pregnancy once their athlete’s performance had benefited from it. This is still </span><a href=""https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/abortion-doping-real-practice/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">unproven</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, so let’s just look at the facts of pregnancy against how athletes have tried to enhance their performance. </span><b>Higher Blood Volume &amp; Stronger Heart</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some athletes use tools like </span><a href=""https://www.progressivemedicalcenter.com/why-do-athletes-use-hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">hyperbaric chambers</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, or go old school and train at </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4789936/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">altitudes </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to increase the number of red blood cells in their body so that they increase their oxygen carrying capacity. Muscles require oxygen for energy, so having more blood and therefore more oxygen means the muscles can worker harder than they could have before. When pregnant,  a </span><a href=""http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/12756474""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">woman’s blood volume</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> increases so there is enough to support herself and the growing baby. A pregnant woman’s heart also increases in size in order to support the demand for blood. Tie these together with a less vascular resistance and you get superhero-like oxygen carrying capacity. So, theoretically, a pregnant woman has the effects of altitude training without having to put herself through altitude training.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/serena.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-7767 alignnone"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/serena.jpg"" alt="""" width=""272"" height=""412"" /></a><b>Hormonal Changes</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Everyone is well aware that while women are pregnant they experience major changes to their </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3640235/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">hormones</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. What is great about this is the increase in oestrogen and progesterone could potentially alter the woman’s metabolism in a way that is favourable for training. The change would mean that she uses more of her fat stores for energy (fat provides more energy per gram than any other fuel source), leaving her carbohydrate stores to be used at a later time. How does this affect the athletic performance of women? Well imagine you are working out and before the workout you ate a high carbohydrate meal to give you enough energy for the workout. Where most people would burn through their carbohydrate stores and feel fatigued early on, a pregnant woman could theoretically prolong her workout with high levels of energy before using a significant amount of carbohydrates.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These are potential theories as to how pregnancy basically makes you superhuman, but most of us aren’t looking for that edge, so how can we use exercise to make pregnancy and post-pregnancy easy? The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology have created a very thorough document outlining why women should exercise pre-,during, and post-pregnancy. If you would like more information you can find it </span><a href=""https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Physical-Activity-and-Exercise-During-Pregnancy-and-the-Postpartum-Period""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span><ol><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Talk to your doctor first. Some pregnancies can be more complicated based on a woman’s predisposition to conditions and complications, so special guidelines should be set by the doctor
</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have been working out, then just keep doing what you’re doing! As the pregnancy progresses certain changes will have to be made to respect the physiological changes of the mother and child, but your overall training does not need to change much. Tess Franklin, one of our newest team members and mommy of 3, said she was doing pull-ups the night before she delivered one of her children!

</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have not been exercising, you can still begin a training program. Expect the training intensity to be low, and the progression to be slow. Exercise is technically a stressor on the body, so adding it to your life while you are also adapting to the changes of pregnancy can be overwhelming if you try to do too much too soon.</span></li></ol><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Becoming a mother does not mean you have to give up the fit lifestyle you once had. It can be a great opportunity to improve your own health while also creating a healthy environment for your child to grow! </span>To all of the great mom’s and mom’s-to-be, Happy Mother’s Day!

The app asks you to make a commitment contract upon signing up and you can even bet money on yourself! As you progress through your habit tracking experience, you can choose friends to hold you accountable to your goals and help keep you motivated on those days when you can’t find the motivation within yourself.</span><a href=""https://www.myfitnesspal.com/apps""><b>MyFitness Pal</b></a><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stick2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7780"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stick2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""841"" height=""528"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you haven’t already heard of MyFitnessPal, it is the one of the most downloaded health and fitness apps across all platforms. This nutrition tracking app has a massive database of foods, allows you to scan barcodes to log food, will track exercise and water, provides health related articles, and can even give you a macro and calorie break down based on your goals. The app is free but is available in a premium format for $8/month. The premium version allows you to set macro goals by grams (free version is by percentages only), you can customize your food journal, and receive more stats about the way you are eating. If you are looking to get a better sense of your caloric intake or macro breakdown this is a great app. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the downfalls of this app is that their multipliers can over and underestimate calories. The exercise multiplier (ie. the formula that calculates how many calories you burned working out) cannot take into account your individual metabolism, so it could give you a much higher or a much lower number then what you actually burned. The calorie requirements that they produce for various goals are massively underestimated. If you have any friends who have used the app to lose weight you probably heard them say they needed to eat 1200 calories. Growing children need 1500 calories to just help them grow and be healthy, so an adult who is working and exercising should not try to be limiting themselves to 1200 calories a day. It really is not sustainable. Your best bet it to find how many calories you can eat that gives you energy, supports recovery, and keeps you feeling sane.</span><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.jamesgay.fitnotes&amp;hl=en""><b>FitNotes</b></a><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stick3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7781"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stick3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""817"" height=""462"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This app is great for tracking your workouts.

The app coaches you through a workout so you can just put your headphones in, press play and get a pretty good workout in. This app is great for those of you looking to fill in the gaps in your training schedule, are travelling and need bodyweight workout to get you sweating, and is great for beginners. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The only thing we can say about this app is that many of the technical movements are included in the workouts and so you have to be monitoring your form yourself. If you have never been coached through a squat, deadlift, push-up, pull up, or plank, we recommend you do so before trying the workouts. You can also start the app, but no one is holding you accountable to finish the workout, so for those of you who struggle with staying motivated to workout, this style of training may not be right for you.</span><a href=""https://charitymiles.org""><b>Charity Miles</b></a><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stick5.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7783"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stick5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""558"" height=""484"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This really takes the cake for best fitness app. While there are apps like Pact and DietBet that pay/reward you for winning at weight loss and other fitness challenges, Charity Miles rewards your activity by donating to charity.

27,High Rep Low Load vs. Low Rep High Load,https://freeformfitness.ca/high-rep-low-load-vs-low-rep-high-load/,"Mon, 28 May 2018 18:09:02 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7786,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the best things about weight training is how much you can vary the workouts. This high level of variability means that you have an infinite number of ways to program your workouts. With that said, there is quite a bit of research that goes into the rep/set/load scheme of a workout so if you want to make the most out of your training, it is important to understand how manipulating these values can serve your training goals. </span><b>High Rep/Low Load Training</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As trainers we like to use this combination early in a client’s fitness journey to help teach their bodies how to perform a movement. Some of you may have heard the theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill, well this is the idea with the higher rep scheme. Trainers may ask you to do 15-20 reps of something with what feels like no weight. This isn’t because we think you can’t handle heavier weights, it is actually because we want you to master the movement.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/reps.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7787"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/reps.jpg"" alt="""" width=""737"" height=""411"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We spend so much time mindlessly moving, but this can lead to compensations and the body moving sub-optimally. By performing many reps at a low load it means we can ensure your body gets used to doing the movement properly and safely. Once we feel comfortable with your form, then we will begin to challenge the movement and the muscles with high loads.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At this point we can choose to keep the rep range the same and increase the weight, or decrease the reps. This is how we start to develop strength in the muscles. Our bodies are highly adaptable and are always looking for ways to repair, recover and make the next time a little bit easier. This is the basis for progressive overload in personal training. So when we increase the weight and keep the reps in the mid-to-high range (10-12+), trainers are looking to increase the muscle’s time under tension. The longer the muscle is under tension, the greater the number of metabolic byproducts there are. Once the workout is complete, the muscles will begin the repair and recovery phase. The more byproducts we have in the muscle, the more material the body has to use to put the muscle back together. </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25853914""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">More muscle = more strength</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/reps2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7788"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/reps2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""737"" height=""523"" /></a><b>Low Rep/High Load</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So what about those individuals in the gym who are lifting only one or two reps in the gym? Are they just being lazy? Are they lifting more than they should? Well, hopefully not.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Low rep matched with a high load is a really interesting concept that has come out of exercise </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26848545""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">research</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Where the higher rep work will test the muscle, lower rep work with high enough load will actually work both the brain and the muscle. Now, with that said, the brain is also being trained in the higher rep workouts, it is just that during the low load sets the nervous system is what we are trying to train. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In your muscle there are areas called motor units. A motor unit is the group of muscle cells all connected by a motor neuron, which is the nervous system’s connection to the muscles. When we train with heavier weights and lower loads we are training the brain to recruit as many of the motor neurons as possible. This is true strength.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/reps3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7789"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/reps3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""867"" height=""558"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the lower load workouts your nervous system will only activate as much of the muscle as required to move the weight to conserve energy. This is why we keep the reps low to move heavy weights. Keep the rep demand low so we can move </span><a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/xcell2.htm""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">more weight</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Every rep should be perfectly executed, and we are not looking to “feel the burn” with this kind of workout. Your muscles can still be sore from a strength training workout, but this is because you have asked a larger area of the muscle to contract. With every contraction comes micro-tears in the muscle and therefore some soreness can be expected but is not the goal. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another thing to note with this kind of rep-set-load scheme is that because you are training the nervous system as well as the muskuloskeletal system, you might feel more tired than usual. Your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) have just allocated a number of resources to help you move that weight, so they will require some time to recover those resources. </span><b>So which one is better?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is a common question we get from clients. Should they do high rep/low load or low rep/high load to achieve optimal fitness levels? Hopefully this article has helped you understand that the rep-set-load scheme that trainers choose serves a specific purpose. If one of those variables changes throughout your program, then your fitness levels will also progress. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Will one of them get you to your goals faster? That is tough to answer because how quickly you reach your goal is dependent on so much more than the number of reps you do in the gym. If your nutrition, sleep, stress management, and activities outside the gym support the workouts, then you will reach your goals faster than if one or many of those is being neglected. How much you lift and how many times you lift that will either make you better, bigger, or stronger.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a final note, this article only scratches the surface of programming workouts. There are so many other ways to manipulate the training variables. If something seems repetitive, easy, or just out-right weird, know that it is in your program for a reason.</span>",,7786,2018-05-28 14:09:02,2018-05-28 18:09:02,closed,open,high-rep-low-load-vs-low-rep-high-load,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,personal-trainer-articles,Personal Trainer Articles,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,7787,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,60,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,25,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595281817,shared_counts_total,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,Benefits of Meditation,https://freeformfitness.ca/benefits-of-meditation/,"Mon, 04 Jun 2018 14:58:15 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7811,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With the launch of Meditation on the Hill, we are going to share with you 7 benefits of a regular meditation practice. It may seem as though meditation is something only buddhists and yogi’s do, but having a regular meditation practice is a part of many successful entrepreneurs and athlete’s daily routine. So how can it change your life and how can you start meditating? Read on to find out more!</span><ol><li><b>It Improves Mental and Functional Health</b></li></ol><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In a </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3352577/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> out of Australia they compared the health of Sahaja Yoga Meditators to the general population. The practitioners and the non-practitioners were asked to fill out a questionnaire and that gave researchers insight into their general pain, social functioning, general health, and mental health - to name a few. There were very strong correlations between frequency of mental silence and vitality, mental health, and general health. </span><ol start=""2""><li><b> You can achieve greater emotional control</b></li></ol><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This form of Sahaja meditation has also been tested down to the gray matter on the brain. Participants were asked to achieve deep mental silence in an MRI scanner. For any of you who have had an MRI done you may have experienced some anxiety as the space you have is very small. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The participants who were able to achieve greater mental silence in the machine presented more gray matter in the </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">medial-fronto-insular striatal</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> cortex of the brain - try saying that 10x fast! This area of the brain is linked to emotions and attention and therefore the individuals who were very good at reaching the state of mental silence have a stronger connection, and therefore control, of their attention and emotions.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-7812"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-1024x571.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""571"" /></a><ol start=""3""><li><b> You can relax your parasympathetic nervous system and decrease cortisol levels</b></li></ol><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For those of you who are unfamiliar with the different subsections of the nervous system, we have the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). The parasympathetic nervous system control our vital functions like </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">breathing and heartbeat - the functions that need to occur involuntarily in order for us to stay alive. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When subjects were asked to practice inward-attention meditation, results showed that their parasympathetic nervous system responded to the slow and controlled breathing. Our PNS reacts to outside stimulus and adjusts heart rate, breathing rate, and hormone levels accordingly. This means that in times of stress, the PNS kicks everything into high gear. Heart rate goes up, breathing rate goes up, and cortisol levels (your stress hormone) skyrocket. Knowing that inward-attention meditation can actually help us control the PNS means that when we recognize we are in a situation that is highly stressful, we can take a moment to bring the body back to a more relaxed state.</span><ol start=""4""><li><b> The many forms of meditation have been prescribed as medicinal therapy</b></li></ol><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In Japanese culture there it is common for medical practitioners to prescribe a <a href=""https://qz.com/804022/health-benefits-japanese-forest-bathing/"">Forest Bath</a>. This is a form of meditation in that it asks the patient to go out into a forest and just take in their surroundings. Quietness is encouraged and some healthy introspection is expected.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So how can a walk through the park improve your well-being? Japan spent a good amount of money researching this and discovered that trees, plants, and even some fruits and vegetables emit an essential oil called phytoncide that protects them against disease and infection. When subjects of the study were brought in for the research their natural killer cell levels were tested before and after their forest bathing session. Results showed that the bodies ability to fight off disease and infection improved after the walk through the forest and the natural killer cell levels stayed elevated for about month.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7813"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""584"" height=""373"" /></a>

&nbsp;
<ol start=""5""><li><b> It can potentially slow aging</b></li></ol><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Scientists have observed that individuals who meditate show signs of aging much slower than those who do practice. This could be due to the fact that individuals who meditate have good heart health, low stress levels, better emotional control, and better immune systems and thus do live in a healthier body that will show fewer signs of weathering.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7814"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""672"" height=""501"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the best things about meditation is that how you meditate is completely up to you. There are so many techniques and forms of meditation out there that you are likely to find one, or many that fit your lifestyle.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It can take as little as 2 minutes, or as long as several days, but no matter how long it lasts meditation can bring you the sense of relaxation and quiet that you have been looking for in this crazy, busy world we live in. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you’ve got a lunch break from 12pm to 1pm on Monday’s, then why not try out meditation on the hill this summer!</span></i>",,7811,2018-06-04 10:58:15,2018-06-04 14:58:15,closed,open,benefits-of-meditation,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,personal-trainer-articles,Personal Trainer Articles,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,7812,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,25,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595281864,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,What Is Bloating?,https://freeformfitness.ca/free-form-fitness-blog-what-is-bloating/,"Mon, 11 Jun 2018 15:05:23 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7837,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bloating - we have all experienced it, and have all wondered what exactly is happening to our bodies? Why do certain foods make us feel bloated? What exactly is happening to the stomach to create the high-pressure, air-filled sensation? What can we do to decrease or eliminate bloating? This week we hope to answer all of these questions and hopefully help you experience this a little less!</span><b>What is bloating?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The direct </span><a href=""https://www.google.ca/search?q=what+is+bloating&amp;oq=what+is+bloating&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i61j0l4.1744j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">definition</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of bloat/bloating is when something becomes filled with a fluid or a gas. In the case of human bloating, it is the latter that is likely the cause. Our bodies are processing many different metabolic reactions at any given moment, so when these reactions are more extreme or rapid, gases can be released as a byproduct of the reaction. This explanation grossly over simplifies what may actually cause that full-belly feeling.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/goffy.gif""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7838"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/goffy.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""263"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In fact, researchers are unable to pin-point one specific reason for bloating. Some research </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3816178/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">cites</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> gastro-intestinal sensitivity and imbalanced gut microflora as the most common reasons that individuals experience bloating. The hypersensitive stomachs may not be well equipped to process the breakdown of certain foods, and therefore release gas into the stomach area as a byproduct of an incomplete, or fast breakdown. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Imbalanced gut microflora can also cause excessive gas build-up because the gut microflora eat and breakdown the food that you are digesting, they release gases into the intestinal area, which could contribute to bloat.</span><b>What can we do to decrease bloating?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With hypersensitivity, and gut flora now pegged as two of the more common reasons for bloating, we can begin to create solutions in order to avoid bloating.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tea.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7839"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tea.jpg"" alt="""" width=""307"" height=""469"" /></a><ol><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Practice Moderation</span></li></ol><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Quite often people experience bloating after consuming a very large meal. The quick consumption of large quantities of food can actually incorporate air into your food. So while you body tries to digest a very large amount of food, it is also processing the excess air that you inhaled while eating. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your quickest fix for bloating is to practice moderation and try not to wolf down your food to quickly.</span><ol><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Pay attention to potential food allergens</span></li></ol><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Returning to the hypersensitivity of the gut and gut flora, if you are consuming foods that your body does not have the enzymes to break down due to allergies or other diseases/conditions, then this could trigger bloating. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you are experiencing bloating on a fairly regular basis and are eating food in moderation, then try keeping tracking of the foods that cause the most irritation. You could have a sensitivity to something in the food that is causing you to bloat.</span><ol><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Avoid sugar alcohols</span></li></ol><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Those little bacteria that make up your gut flora love sugar, so when you consume foods that contain </span><a href=""https://www.sharecare.com/health/carbohydrates/what-are-examples-sugar-alcohols""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sugar alcohols</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> your microflora gobble that stuff up and produce gas in the process. Some examples of sugar alcohols are sorbitol, xylitol, erythritol, and isomalt.</span><ol><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Talk to your doctor</span></li></ol><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the other most common reasons for bloating is actually chronic conditions/diseases.

30,Foods that cause and fight inflammation,https://freeformfitness.ca/foods-that-cause-and-fight-inflammation/,"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 14:08:18 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7862,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After reading last week’s blog you may have already tried a few of our tips to reduce bloating. Whether it was slowing down while eating, or avoiding certain foods, if you have been consistent you may have already started to feel a difference! </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For some of you, though, this may not be the case. Despite your best efforts that all-over puffy-ness just will not go away. Don’t let that discourage you. We live in an age of information, and so we have put in the research to help you un-puff and really start to see the results of your hard work!</span><b>What Is Causing the Puff?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our bodies are never trying to do anything to hurt us and the puffy-ness we experience is another great example of this. Chronic low-grade inflammation is a response by the body that is actually there to protect us.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Under normal conditions</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579563/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> inflammation</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is a process in the body that is localised and brought on by injury or infection. The body sends more blood, specializes cells, and other chemicals to begin the process of eliminating toxins, infections, or anything else that takes us away from </span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">homeostasis</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. The influx of chemicals and blood in the localised area can make that area look puffy, or inflamed. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So how does localised inflammation for things like sprained ankles, or broken wrists translate to inflamed midlines when there hasn’t been an injury? </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Think of low-grade inflammation as your body’s guard dog. It isn’t always on attack mode, but it is constantly monitoring body, ready to strike when things get really bad. Our body calls on the guard dog (low-grade inflammation) in response to a number of </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579563/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">chronic health conditions</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and non-alchoholic fatty-liver disease are a few of the most common reasons that low-grade inflammation is present in the body.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7864"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""388"" height=""424"" /></a><b>What Can You Do About It</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For the above mentioned chronic health conditions there are 4 major risk factors that you can control:</span><ul><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sedentary lifestyle</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diet</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stress</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Smoking</span></li></ul><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you want to avoid unnecessary inflammation in the body and lower your risk of developing a disease or condition mentioned earlier, then you can reduce your sedentary behaviour by getting active (</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">maybe by seeing one of our amazing trainers?!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">), develop strategies to manage your stress </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(like working out at an FFF gym?!)</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, avoid smoking, and the last one, and our focus for the rest of the blog, you can change your diet!</span><b>Foods That Cause Inflammation</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fight inflammation begins by limiting foods that cause inflammation in the body. The following </span><a href=""https://www.eatthis.com/foods-that-cause-inflammation/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">foods</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> should be consumed in small quantities to reduce unnecessary inflammation in the body:</span><ul><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sugars</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: High levels of glucose in the blood lowers our bod’s germ-killing abilities, and increases the cytokine levels in the body. Cytokines are cells in the body that help with the inflammatory response in the body.</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Omega-6-rich Oils</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: Certain vegetable oils have a much higher concentration of inflammation-causing omega-6 oils than others. Soy, palm, and sunflower are just a few examples that can make your Omega-6 to Omega-3 ratio up to 20:1, when it should be 1:1!</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Refined Grains:</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> When grains are stripped of all of their fibers and nutrients that slow down the digestion process all they are left with are high concentrations of glucose and easy-to-digest carbohydrates. This fast digestion causes an insulin spike in the body which has been cited as a cause of inflammation.</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dairy</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: Last week we mentioned that certain allergens can cause bloating in the body. Well, dairy is a very common allergen and can therefore cause inflammation in the body as well. Although a small portion of full fat, plain, probiotic yogurt can be helpful in reducing inflammation by supporting our gut microbiome, foods like cheeses, and milk products have been shown to increase the inflammatory response in the body.</span></li></ul><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Grain-Fed Meats</span><b>: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Grains were not a part of the diet that helped animals like chickens, cows, and pigs evolve. In the large-scale farming operations that are now very common, farmers have to give the animals antibiotics to help them stay healthy on this unnatural diet. The meat in those animals absorbs the antibiotics and this can lead to inflammation in the individuals who eat that meat. Does that mean giving up meat altogether? No - you just have to do a little research to find the grass-fed, free range animals. Thankfully there has been a rise in popularity of these kinds of farming practices so you can find many grass-fed meat products at the local farmer’s markets around the city.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7863"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""391"" height=""584"" /></a><b>Foods that Fight Inflammation</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now for the good stuff; the foods that can actually help to</span><a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/foods-that-fight-inflammation""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> fight</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> the inflammation response and get rid of that puffy-ness!</span><ul><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tomatoes</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Leafy green vegetables</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fruits</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nuts</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fatty-fish</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Olive Oil</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some Herbs and Spices</span></li></ul><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7865"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""669"" height=""544"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a final note, we always like to remind you that moderation is key. We have listed here food that is both good and bad for inflammation. If you</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> limit</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> your consumption of the “bad” you should be able to control unnecessary inflammation. Consuming more of the “good” will also help reduce inflammation.

31,The Nordic Diet,https://freeformfitness.ca/the-nordic-diet/,"Tue, 26 Jun 2018 12:53:33 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7876,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You may have heard of dietitians and health practitioners praising the mediterranean diet lately. This diet was inspired by what the spanish, greeks, and italians would normally eat and included recommendations like more olive oil, fish, legumes, fruits and vegetables, while enjoying moderate amount of unrefined cereals and non-fish meats. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is a new style of diet that is starting to gain popularity as well and it comes from the land of vikings and the world’s top crossfit athletes.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7877"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""713"" height=""378"" /></a><b>The Nordic Diet</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7878"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""672"" height=""446"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It turns out our scandinavian friends have been keeping their secret to good health hidden away in the north all this time. Scandinavian countries have some of the lowest obesity rates of the developed countries. Despite most of them experiencing cooler temperatures and little-to-no sunlight in the summer months (common reasons westerner’s indulge in comfort food), the nordic nations keep themselves in excellent health. Nutrition scientists are now taking a look at this very simple diet as the new front-runner for diets.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As with many of the region-specific diets, a lot of the foods are what make sense for the region they come from. The mediterranean diet includes olive oil, fruits, vegetables, and cereals because those are naturally abundant in that area. The scandinavian countries would have only had winter vegetables, game meat, fish, and hearty rye bread at their disposal and so those are the core foods consumed in a nordic diet. </span><b>Why is it working?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is a tricky argument to break down. Yes - many of the food sources in the nordic diet boast greater nutrient density: more omega 3’s and 6’s, greater antioxidant concentration, lean and clean protein sources - all of these are what research has shown to be beneficial to a healthy diet. It is important to keep in mind that ancestrally this diet makes sense for those of us who came from the nordic nations. If our ancestors survived on this food, then it makes sense that we are benefitting from eating in such a way that is more </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">natural</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Our genetics like this diet; it makes sense for our body to use these foods as fuel. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This diet is also another example of how whole foods are the better option in any diet. There are so many processed versions of food out there that we have lost touch with what a regular meal looks like. Bringing our diets back to the basics of good quality rye bread, fish, seasonal fruits and vegetables simplifies the digestion process and so we can expect to look and feel better because of it.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7879"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/3-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""274"" height=""407"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Is the Nordic diet the magic pill to perfect health? We would be foolish to make that statement, but we can say that there are ideas and principles in this diet that we could all benefit from incorporating into our lives.</span><b>A Typical Day in the Nordic Diet</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Want to give this diet a try?

32,HEALTHY BACKYARD BBQ,https://freeformfitness.ca/healthy-backyard-bbq/,"Tue, 03 Jul 2018 12:45:06 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=7911,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">July is a time for cottages, sunshine and backyard barbeques. It is the peak of summertime fun and one of the easiest ways to get off track from your healthy lifestyle. Chips, white buns, beer, and sugar-y condiments all add up quickly and without even knowing it you may be well over your caloric needs for the day from just one meal. This week we hope to share some fun and easy ways to enjoy a barbeque without worrying about diet.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bbq.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7912"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bbq.jpg"" alt="""" width=""807"" height=""535"" /></a><b>What Are You Really Consuming?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before we give you our tips and tricks to avoid the bbq bloat, it is important for us to show you just how much junk is in the usual barbeque foods and beverages.
</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nutrition-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-7932"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nutrition-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""574"" height=""277"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before we talk about how this isn’t an ideal meal, we should point out that as far as sugar goes, this type of meal is not the worst for sugar. Unfortunately the rest of those numbers are not great. Keep in mind as well that this is for a single serve portion of each of these items. It is common for people to have  hamburger and a hot dog, or a couple varieties of chips, or multiple beers and maybe even a summery dessert if it is on offer. Do you see how quickly these can all add up? Many of the above-mentioned foods are also lacking in nutrient density. Bread, ketchup, chips, and beer are essentially all empty calories because all they give you is carbohydrates. The healthy fats and muscle building proteins are lacking in this type of backyard bbq meal.</span><b>A BBQ for the Health Conscious</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now that we know how easy it is to build up the empty calories at a regular BBQ, let’s look at a few healthier options. In this case healthier options include foods that are high in healthy fats and proteins. The additional options also provide excellent micronutrients and additional health benefits. There are so many options in the grocery stores nowadays that we really don’t have to conform to the old style of barbeques simply because that’s how they used to be prepared. </span><b>Instead of a Classic Hamburger - Try a Lettuce Wrapped burger, or a burger on a slice of rye bread</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lettuce.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7913"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lettuce.jpg"" alt="""" width=""997"" height=""321"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We already established above that the burger patty really isn’t the worst thing to eat. Find yourself a lean, ground-beef patty from a grass-fed source and instead of putting it on a plain white bun, throw it on a bed of lettuce. Romaine lettuce comes loaded with additional vitamins and minerals like 82% of your vitamin A, and a little vitamin C, Calcium and Iron. You can also load your plate up with lettuce and keep your calories low. For 1 cup of romaine lettuce there’s only 8kcals! There’s no fat, 2g of carbs, and 1g of fiber, sugar and there’s even a little protein!. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Last week we talked about how rye bread is a staple in the nordic diet. This is because rye bread takes bread back to basics. Instead of being stuffed with all kinds of preservatives and strange ingredients, rye bread is simply water, flour, yeast and a bit of salt. For 1 slice of rye bread there’s only 83 kcals, 15g of carbs, 2g of fiber, 0 sugars, and 3 g of protein!</span><b>Instead of Chips - Try a high protein hors d’oeuvre option!</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chips are so easy to grab at the store and with so many flavour options you know that every guest will be satisfied. Unfortunately chips are one of those snacks that increase your caloric intake without you even realizing. Also who counts out 36 chips?</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are SO many high protein hors d’oeuvre and appetizer options out there that you can make in bulk and serve as a side at your next barbeque. These may take a bit longer to prepare than just opening up a bag of chips and pouring in a bowl but your healthy habits will thank-you for taking the time to do it. You can do barbeque’d veggies skewers, or fruit bowls, or get really creative with recipes like these: </span><a href=""https://www.sugarfreemom.com/recipes/homemade-white-cheddar-cucumber-chips/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">White Cheddar Cucumber Chips</span></a><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cucumber.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-7914"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cucumber.jpg"" alt="""" width=""514"" height=""346"" /></a><a href=""https://www.sugarfreemom.com/recipes/salt-and-vinegar-zucchini-chips/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Salt and Vinegar Zucchini Chips</span></a>",,7911,2018-07-03 08:45:06,2018-07-03 12:45:06,closed,open,healthy-backyard-bbq,publish,0,0,post,,0,,,,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,8,_thumbnail_id,7912,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,60,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,category,nutrition,Nutrition,category,personal-trainer-articles,Personal Trainer Articles,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595151055,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If that means having a few extra coffees to stay awake and make it to sundown, then go for it. The body’s natural sleep cycles are driven by the sun, and so if you fall asleep when it is dark and wake up the next time that it is light, you will have a great, deep sleep and you should adjust more quickly. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Travelling somewhere that doesn’t have a clear sunset or sunrise (far north in Canadian summers, and far south in Canadian winters)? Make sure you have melatonin and a really good eye mask. Check your accommodations beforehand to make sure they have black out blinds and pick a time to fall asleep that will give you 7-9 hours of restful sleep.</span><b>Walk as much as possible</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Walking may not be the biggest calorie burner in the world, but the more you walk the better. This is also a great way to see the city you are travelling to and really take in all of the sights and sounds giving you a richer travel experience. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Speaking of which, walking most places gives you the added benefit of saving money on transportation!</span><b>Stay Hydrated</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is so easy to get caught up in the experience of travel and completely forget to drink water. Dehydration can quickly lead to nausea, lack of energy, mental fogginess, and may even make you more inclined to eat when you are not hungry. This is because the brain begins to misinterpret body signals when it is dehydrated. So you may be interpreting simple dehydration for hunger.</span><b>Go Prepared with a Quick Bodyweight Workout</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When travelling there isn’t always the option of a well-equipped gym. If you don’t want to miss a workout then go prepared with a quick workout that you can do wherever you are. Here’s a sample workout routine that you can do anywhere!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Circuit 1:</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Bodyweight push-ups: 30s</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Suitcase Bicep Curls (empty or full suitcase - you decide): 30s</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Plank: 30s-1m</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Repeat 2-4x, or set a timer for as long as you want and finish as many rounds as you can</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Circuit 2: </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Squat or Jump Squat: 20s</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reverse Lunges:  20s</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Glute Kickbacks: 20s</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Side Planks: 20s each</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Repeat 2-4x, or set a timer for as long as you want and finish as many rounds as you can</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can add or replace any of these exercises depending on your range of motion, equipment available, and time. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Travelling is truly a special experience that we can all benefit from and now with these tips and tricks you can have a happy and healthy holiday!</span>",,7971,2018-07-09 10:51:15,2018-07-09 14:51:15,closed,open,healthy-travel-tips,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,personal-trainer-q-and-a,Personal Trainer Q and A,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,7975,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,60,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,29,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1594963877,shared_counts_total,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,What is sweat?,https://freeformfitness.ca/what-is-sweat/,"Mon, 16 Jul 2018 13:06:01 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8005,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We have all likely accepted it as a fact of life when you go out on a hot, sunny day, or you hit a workout really hard. Any of these scenarios and a host of other situations in life prompt sweating. But have you ever asked yourself what exactly sweat is? Why does it happen? Or why does it happen more to other people than ourselves? This week we are finally going to break down what sweat is, why we sweat and why you may sweat more or less than other people.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8014"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""207"" height=""216"" /></a><b>What is Sweat</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sweat is a liquid excreted from the body via our sweat glands. Sweat is mostly made of water as well as some other chemicals like ammonia, urea, and sugar. Ammonia and urea are byproducts of the breakdown of proteins in our bodies.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Notice a certain smell when you sweat? This is actually because of the bacteria on your skin. These little bacteria interact with the sweat and the byproduct can be a sticky, smelly substance. This is why you can feel sticky after working out and not showering immediately. The more bacteria and chemicals in the sweat, the more these reactions occur and the smellier you are!</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8015"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""309"" height=""206"" /></a><b>Why do we sweat?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So what biological need does sweating serve? If you think about the times you sweat - you have a fever, you are outside on a hot day, you are pushing through a really tough workout - all of these are related to your body’s temperature being elevated. The body sweats because it needs to cool off.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our bodies are like experiment beakers - they require the perfect conditions for reactions to occur. There are hundreds of thousands occuring in our body every day and each of these require an internal temperature of around 98.6 degrees fahrenheit, or 37 degrees celsius. So when we partake in activities that increase our body temperature, it needs a quick way to keep the temperature down so we can stay alive.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sweating brings fluids to the surface of the skin. As the sweat builds on the warm skin, it actually evaporates. The evaporation is what cools the skin, taking the warm water away from the body.</span><b>So why do I sweat more/less than other people?</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/giphy.gif""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8012"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/giphy.gif"" alt="""" width=""1920"" height=""1076"" /></a><b></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are <a href=""https://www.livescience.com/41561-why-do-i-sweat-so-much.html"">two ways</a> that you can sweat more/less than someone else. You can either have generalized hyperhidrosis, meaning you perspire A LOT all over, or you can have focal hyperhidrosis, which usually means you sweat a lot from the armpits, feets, and hands.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For generalized hyperhidrosis this can actually be a sign of something more serious. Metabolic disorders like diabetes and hyperthyroidism, as well as infections and lymphatic tumours can all be expressed in excessive, generalized sweating. This kind of sweating can also be a symptom of withdrawals from alcohol and other substances. Lastly, changes in hormones, such as menopause, can cause generalized hyperhidrosis.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Focal hyperhidrosis is less serious and can just be something that runs in the family. This type of excessive sweating in the palms, soles of the feet, and armpits can also be an indication of a malfunction in the area of nervous system that controls thermoregulation.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Does sweat vary based on fitness or body fat percentage? A study published in the <a href=""https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19520755/what-determines-how-much-you-sweat/"">Journal of Applied Physiology</a> found that someone’s fitness (VO2 max in this case) and their body fat percentage accounted for only a small percentage of difference in the amount of sweat they produced.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sweating is yet another piece of evidence that shows us that we are all unique systems. Yes - we run on similar operating systems, but our individual settings will determine how much we sweat, our metabolism, our response to certains kinds of exercise, and so many more variables.</span>

35,Good Carb vs. Bad Carb,https://freeformfitness.ca/good-carb-vs-bad-carb/,"Mon, 23 Jul 2018 12:23:56 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8032,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Recently carbs (carbohydrates) have become the enemy of diet world. With diets like the Atkins, Paleo, and Keto diet being heavily promoted, carbs are getting a bad reputation as a the source of all of our weight-gaining problems. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Amidst all of the anti-carb sentiment, there are still whispers of something called good carbs. If this is true, how do you know which is which? To help you make more informed decisions about your carbs, here is a breakdown of good carbs vs. bad carbs.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/n-CARBOHYDRATES-628x314.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8034"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/n-CARBOHYDRATES-628x314.jpg"" alt="""" width=""628"" height=""314"" /></a><b>What is a Carb?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A carbohydrate is anything with a chemical structure of a carbon atom linked to a number of hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms (hence carb-o-hydrate). There are many different chemical variations of carbohydrates. For humans we ingest carbohydrates in the form of mono-, di-, and polysaccharides. Each means either a chain of 1, 2 or many carbohydrates, respectively. The more complex the carb, the longer it takes to break it down. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some examples of the simple carbs are glucose, fructose (fruit sugar), and galactose which is commonly found in sugar beets and gums. These are all sugars that are found in simple carbohydrates and are therefore very easy for the body to break down. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the past, finding sources of carbohydrates like these was beneficial. When we needed a quick boost of energy to get us through the next few miles of hunting and gathering, we could grab some berries and be on our way. Nowadays, we have an abundance of energy, and therefore these sources of carbohydrates simply add to a stock pile of energy that we already have in our bodies and are quite often converted to fat. </span><b>Complex Carbs</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Complex carbohydrates are the carbs we eat that are not </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">just</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> carbs. These sources of carbohydrates are usually accompanied by fats proteins, and fibers to help slow down the digestion process. The digestion process is slowed down because the molecular structure of the food </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">is more complex.</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Get it?</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So what are some examples of these? Well starch and cellulose are great examples of the polysaccharides we mentioned before. This is why high fiber vegetables that are high in cellulose are so great for us. Starchy carbs like potatoes and good quality pastas also come with greater nutrient density and are therefore a great source of complex carbohydrates. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before we go out and buy a bunch of pasta and potatoes and get the carbohydrate fix we have all been craving, make sure you look at the ingredient list. So many of the pastas we consume have been stripped of their nutritional value to become more refined and more palatable to the north american consumer. As our crops go through more and more modification, we lose some of the healthy qualities. So if you are going to be buying pastas and potatoes, make sure you are getting the least refined pastas, and locally grown, organic potatoes. </span><b>So are Carbs the Enemy?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Carbs are not the enemy. Although there is a growing body of research that supports reducing our carbohydrate intake, it would be tough to completely eliminate carbs from our diet. Complete avoidance of carbs would mean you would be eating a strict diet of meat and oils because vegetables and fruits are carbohydrates. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you go to enjoy your next meal, take a look at your plate. Does it include colourful foods? If there are carbs on there, are they simple or complex? How much of your plate do they take up? Does that quantity of carbs serve your greater health and fitness goals? These are the questions we should be asking if we are concerned about carbohydrate intake. And, of course, if you are ever unsure about how much carbs you should be eating, talk to a professional about what is right for you!</span>",,8032,2018-07-23 08:23:56,2018-07-23 12:23:56,closed,open,good-carb-vs-bad-carb,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,8034,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595068253,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is true that every body is built differently. We each come with an eclectic mix of genes from our ancestors that have given us the body we have today. Over time, research has identified 3 major trends in body types and it has become very useful in identifying who would be more genetically inclined for certain kinds of sports, or certain types of diets. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With that said, if you find after reading this article that you identify with one of these body types more than the other and it is not the body type you have been “training” for, don’t worry. Our bodies are highly adaptable and will therefore adapt to the training stimulus you give it. So if you have an ectomorph body, but you love lifting heavy, keep pushing the limits of your strength! And if you are an mesomorph body type and love to go out for the long running events, then you should definitely keep running! This article is simply here to educate you, not tell you what you should or should not do.</span><b>Ectomorph</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The first category of somatotype (body-type) is the ectomorph. Individuals with this body type are generally tall, and lean with long limbs and the marathon body. These individuals usually find it difficult to put on weight. Whether they are hitting the gym regularly, trying to eat more, or a combination of the two, it is difficult for these individuals to put on weight. This is due to their characteristically high metabolism. They burn and use the energy they consume through food and hardly store any away for later use.</span><b>Endomorph</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The endomorph somatotype corresponds with individuals who are usually naturally heavier-set. Their body’s are pear shaped and they are commonly quite stocky in their build. While they can put on muscle mass easily, they can also put on fat quite easily as well. When training as an endomorph, it is important to include both cardio and strength training into your program. This will take advantage of your muscle building abilities while staying lean. Endomorphs have a much slower metabolism than the ectomorphs which is why when they consume food, their body is less efficient at using the energy and more efficient at storing it.</span><b>Mesomorph</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mesomorphs can be thought of as the muscle builders. These individuals have an athletic build and are usually rectangular in shape. Broad shoulders and strong muscles all over give them a more filled out, hard body. These individuals have a steady metabolism that helps to feed and maintain their muscle mass, while maintaining and lean look. It is these people who are best suited for weight training. </span><b>So Which One Are You?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Based on the information above, you may now be able to identify which body type you are. With that said, you can also be a combination of body types and can take advantage of the many different training modalities that work best for you unique combination. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once again, we really want to stress that you body type does not put you in a training box. If you are an ectomorph and love weight training, you can still benefit from weight training. It may take you a bit longer to get to a certain lifting goal than a meso or an endomorph, but you’ll still get there if you work at it. The same is true for all of the other body types.</span>",,8046,2018-07-30 13:08:30,2018-07-30 17:08:30,closed,open,there-are-3-different-body-types,publish,0,0,post,,0,,,,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,8047,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,60,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,29,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,category,personal-trainer-articles,Personal Trainer Articles,category,personal-trainer-q-and-a,Personal Trainer Q and A,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595394791,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,Looking to increase your calcium without dairy?,https://freeformfitness.ca/calcium-without-dairy/,"Tue, 07 Aug 2018 19:45:09 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8052,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here on the Free Form Fitness blog we have talked a lot about the importance of certain vitamins and minerals. One of the most important minerals that should be consumed in regular quantities is calcium. With a growing population of individuals presenting with dairy sensitivities and intolerances, calcium is no longer as easy to get into the diet as it once was. There is also increasing evidence that consuming dairy products regularly can lead to unwanted weight gain, skin problems like acne, and gastrointestinal disturbances. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So this week we are not only going to shed a light on the importance of calcium for a healthy lifestyle, but we are also going to share with you where you can get it from that doesn't involve dairy!</span><b>Calcium Benefits</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Calcium is considered a macromineral for humans because we need in quantities as high as 1g per day. It’s main regulatory function in the body is to help maintain healthy bones and teeth, and help delay the onset of osteoporosis, a debilitating disease that causes the bones to become porous and weak.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/calcium.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8053 aligncenter"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/calcium.jpg"" alt="""" width=""629"" height=""362"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The recommended daily intake for calcium is as follows:</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">700mg for children ages 1-3 years old</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1000mg 4-8 years old and ages 19-50</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1300mg for individuals aged 9-18</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1200mg for men older than 70 and women older than 50</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Women who are pregnant should have 1300mg of calcium daily and infants should have around 200-260mg</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">99% of the 1-2kg of calcium in the body is found in the bone tissue. The rest is found in the bloodstream and helps with cell signalling. </span><b>Calcium Deficiency</b><img class=""size-full wp-image-8054 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""336"" height=""194"" /><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although rickets is most commonly linked to a vitamin D deficiency, calcium is closely linked to vitamin D in the body and therefore a deficiency in calcium can also lead to rickets. Some other minor symptoms of calcium deficiency are numbness or tingling fingers, muscle cramping, poor appetite, weak or brittle fingernails, difficulty swallowing, fainting or lethargy. In extreme cases a calcium deficiency can cause mental confusion, irritability, depression and anxiety; tooth erosion, insufficient blood clotting, growth and development delays, and heart problems including abnormal blood pressure and heart rhythms. </span><b>Dairy-Free Calcium Sources</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For starters, there are a ton of ways to enjoy all of your favourite products and get a healthy dose of calcium. There are juices, cereals, breads, and non-dairy milks like rice and almond milk that are fortified with calcium. This makes it really easy to get your daily dose of calcium.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you are looking for more whole food sources of calcium then here is a short list of food and their calcium content to help you make that choice.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-3.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8062 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""322"" height=""520"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Canned sardines: 38%</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cooked soybeans: 18%</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1tbsp of poppy seeds: 126mg or 13%</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1C Wing Beans: 244mg or 24%</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1C white beans: 13%</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">22 almonds: 8%</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whey Protein: 200mg or 20%</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cooked Collard greens: 266mg or 25%</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So whether you are lactose intolerant, or are just trying to cut back on your consumption of dairy products, you now have options to obtain adequate amounts of calcium to keep your body working optimally!</span>

At Free Form Fitness we are always striving to stay on top of trends and providing you with the most up to date information. It is for that reason that we have decided to explore the topic of healthy marijuana consumption, if that is even possible, and how marijuana could positively or negatively affect your health.</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EcDluMqMeo""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Canadian Concerns About Marijuana - CBC</span></a><b>Common Ways to Consume Marijuana/Pot/Weed/Cannabis</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8080 alignnone"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""757"" height=""328"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Marijuana has been around for </span><a href=""https://www.history.com/topics/history-of-marijuana""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">centuries</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Initially used for medicinal purposes, it came into popular use by North American colonists for things like clothing and rope. It wasn’t until the 20th century that marijuana started to get a bad reputation as political leaders of the time decided to criminalize the plant.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now there is a shift in people’s understanding of cannabis. It is used more frequently and openly in the medical community to help manage pain, nausea and other symptoms of chronic </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ailments. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the United States a movement had begun to legalize </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">marijuana </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">for consumption with </span><a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/legal-marijuana-states-2018-1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">9 states</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> already having it fully legalized.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now that Canada is set to legalize marijuana we can start thinking about the ways it can be produced and consumed. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some of the most </span><a href=""https://www.alpha-cat.org/top-15-ways-consume-marijuana/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">common ways</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to consume marijuana are by smoking it through either a joint, a vape, or a bong. Marijuana butter is also used to create edibles like brownies, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">cookies</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, space cakes, and even </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">pizza dough! A few less common and new options are through cannabis chewing gum, topical creams and lotions, and drinks!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Similarly</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to snacks, despite how many options we have available to us, s</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ome are better than others.  This is also true </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">of edible cannabis</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2-1.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8082 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""519"" height=""395"" /></a><b>Healthy vs. Unhealthy Cannabis Consumption</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It should go without saying that the first way to consume anything in a healthy way is in moderation. Should you decide to partake in </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">marijuana </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">consumption, remember that this is a psychoactive drug and that moderation is always better than overindulging. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How you consume the drug can have a healthy, or unhealthy, impact. Smoking of any substance is hard on the lungs. Even though joints and vapes do not have the harsh chemicals found in cigarettes and therefore are </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">not as bad</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> as smoking a cigarette, you are still inhaling a burning substance. Vapes are marginally better as you are inhaling the vapors from the burning plant, but your best bet is to let the lungs breathe in air and only air.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is why, </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">many believe,</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> substances like chewing gum, drinks, topical treatments, and edibles are your best options should you wish to consume marijuana. </span><a href=""http://adai.washington.edu/wadata/marijuana.htm""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In fact,</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> after marijuana was legalized in the US the “bud” </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">(the unprocessed smoked plant) </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">version was initially the most popular, but over time it was the edible versions of the drug that became the most popular product.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lastly, there are two “strains,” or breeds, of marijuana that are commonly consumed. Sativa is the breed that </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">gives some people a little boost. A popular figure in the marijuana movement, </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZKxrs-jOas""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Joe Rogan</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, even promotes a little weed before workouts to boost your focus and energy.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-4.jpg""><img class="" wp-image-8083 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""767"" height=""427"" /></a><a href=""https://www.peacenaturals.com/indica-vs-sativa-understanding-the-differences-between-the-two-cannabis-plants/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Indica</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is the other strain. This strain is more commonly linked to the “chill-out” high and can help reduce stress and relax the individual who chooses to consume it. It has also been shown to soothe joint and muscle soreness, which is why it is common to consume post-workout.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is technically a third strain, hybrids, but these are simply combinations of Sativa and Indica and their respective concentrations are decided based on the need of the user.</span><b>Cannabis and the Fitness Industry</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some of you may have reserved marijuana consumption to parties and evenings of over-analyzing kids cartoons but cannabis has actually been in the fitness industry for quite </span><a href=""https://www.theglobeandmail.com/cannabis/article-can-marijuana-help-make-us-better-athletes/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">some time</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. In the 1998 Olympics a Canadian snowboarder was </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">stripped of his medal because they found THC (the psychoactive compound in </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">marijuana</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) in his blood. In California there is a gym that opened called Power Plant Fitness that </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">allows </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">marijuana</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> consumption by the gym’s members. Many athletes are now admitting to using the plant to boost their workouts and aid with recovery.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now that it’s popularity is really starting to grow there are a number of cannabis supplement companies coming to market like </span><a href=""https://www.peacenaturals.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Peace Naturals</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><a href=""https://canna4supplements.com/shop/pre-workout/cbd-pre-workout-capsules/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Canna Supplements</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. As with all supplement companies, it is important to do your research and ensure that they are producing top quality products. There are always companies that take advantage of a trend and produce low-quality versions of things like pre-workout and post-workout capsules and powders.</span><b>Be Careful Before Your Consume Cannabis</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In researching this topic there was a lot that was discovered about marijuana. The fact that it can also be a stimulant came as a surprise after only seeing images of lazy, stoned, weed smokers in movies and tv shows. The fact that athletes are actually using marijuana to enhance their training and help with their recovery is also a very cool development of marijuana consumption.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the research there are also </span><a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/14/marijuana-side-effects_n_7284694.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">warnings</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> about marijuana that are important to share as well. A research study out of Tel-Aviv university found that mice with a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia showed signs of schizophrenia when exposed to THC. Does this mean the same is true of humans? There have been cases where individuals with a family history of schizophrenia experienced symptoms after prolonged consumption of marijuana.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Marijuana</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> has also been shown to lower an individual’s motivation while high, and actually disrupts the REM cycle of your sleep due to its psycho</span><b>active </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">nature. So, although it may help you fall asleep, the quality of your sleep </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">may be </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">affected. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">marijuana</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> affects one person’s brain compared to the next can vary greatly as well. Some individuals feel relaxed by the drug, but others may report feelings of paranoia and even experience panic attacks from getting high. Weight gain is also a potential risk as marijuana has been shown to increase appetite.</span><b>To Marijuana or not to Marijuana?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your decision to partake in marijuana consumption is entirely up to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">you</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. We have presented just a few of the facts about this natural supplement but we highly encourage you to do more research of your own before deciding whether or not you </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">add marijuana to your fitness regime. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To get you started here are a few resources on marijuana that are worth exploring:</span><a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/services/health/campaigns/cannabis.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cannabis In Canada</span></a><a href=""https://www.ontario.ca/page/cannabis-legalization""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cannabis in Ontario</span></a><a href=""https://www.camh.ca/en/health-info/mental-illness-and-addiction-index/cannabis""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">CAMH Article on Cannabis</span></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nITlICp5SE""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Leafly Video on Differences between Sativa, Indica and Hybrid</span></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmqtPaMMVuY""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">TED Talk on The Truth About Legalizing Weed</span></a>

39,Erythritol - Too Sweet to be True,https://freeformfitness.ca/erythritol-too-sweet-to-be-true/,"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 15:29:25 +0000",admin,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8095,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are many sweeteners on the market right now. Stevia, Sweet’n low (saccharine), aspartame, acesulfame K, Splenda (sucrose) are just some of the common sweeteners you may already know of. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the world of sweets, there are a group of compounds that can also be used to sweeten our food but are allowed to fly under the radar and not count towards the grams of sugar listed on the nutrition facts label. These are known as sugar alcohols.</span><b>Common Sugar Alcohols</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sugar alcohols are special compounds that combine sugars and alcohols. These are the chemical alcohols, though not the ethanol alcohol that is found in products like beer and wine.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once combined they have a caloric value of almost zero, but still carry a sweet taste. Researchers are finding that these are great alternatives to regular sweeteners not only because they have a low calorie count, but also because once in the body some of them do not cause an insulin response!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some of the common sugar alcohols you may find on an ingredient list are xylitol, sorbitol, maltitol, and erythritol. Below is a list of common sweeteners, their sweetness, glycemic index and their calories per gram of sweetener.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1-1.jpg""><img class=""size-large wp-image-8096 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1-1-1024x468.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1024"" height=""468"" /></a><b>Erythritol - The golden child of sugar alcohols</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of that list there is one that has become increasingly popular in the last few months. As the ketogenic diet has come to the forefront of the dieting world, erythritol has been put into use as a way to still indulge in sweet treats without getting out of ketosis.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2-2.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8098 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""623"" height=""498"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">





















Erythritol is a special sugar alcohol because its glycemic index is zero, it does not cause an insulin response like many of the sugar alcohols, and it </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25744158""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">apparently</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> does not cause any stomach distress like some of the others do.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Erythritol is 70% as sweet as sugar, so if you are craving something sweet, this sugar alcohol can certainly do the trick. Once consumed, most of it is absorbed into the bloodstream and then excreted through your urine. The little that is left will continue through the regular digestive pathway. Some researchers have even found in mice that erythritol can act as an antioxidant!</span><b>The not-so-sweet side of erythritol</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-5.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8099 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""307"" height=""413"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As always, we want to do our due diligence to provide all the facts so that you can make an informed decision about the products that you choose to consume. So, although erythritol certainly boasts some impressive health benefits, there are a few things that you should be aware of.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Often erythritol is produced from GMO corn starch. GMO products are the less natural version of a crop and can therefore come with less of the nutrient density and health benefits than their natural counterparts. So, if you choose to consume erythritol, make sure it is an organic version. For many of the products where you can find erythritol, it is buried in a list of ingredients and you can almost guarantee that this erythritol came from a GMO source.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Erythritol does not actually get metabolized by the body, so you can be left feeling hungry, despite the fact you have had something to eat. Overeating is another side effect of sugar alcohol consumption and therefore you should continue to practice moderation and ensure that whatever else you are eating is sufficient to make you feel satiated. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sugar alcohols are definitely a better option than your regular sweeteners like sugar or aspartame. You get that sweet taste without the calories or the insulin spike, but more research should be done if you are thinking of trying out sugar alcohols. Test them out and document how they make you feel. Everybody is different and will therefore react to these compounds in different ways.</span>",,8095,2018-08-20 11:29:25,2018-08-20 15:29:25,closed,open,erythritol-too-sweet-to-be-true,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,_vc_post_settings,"a:1:{s:10:""vc_grid_id"";a:0:{}}",_edit_last,5,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,_thumbnail_id,8099,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595104701,shared_counts_total,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,8.0,9.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,Fast Facts on Intermittent Fasting?,https://freeformfitness.ca/fast-facts-on-intermittent-fasting/,"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 12:53:14 +0000",admin,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8107,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Intermittent fasting is an incredibly controversial eating regime and yet it continues to gain popularity and credibility in the fitness and health industry. The reality is humans have actually been fasting since the beginning of our existence. In fact, all animal species practice intermittent fasting in some form. Whenever our ancestors could not find food, they would fast. As animals wait for prey, they too fast. Every night while you are sleeping you are technically fasting. If you are one of those people who cannot eat breakfast right when you wake up, so you just grab a coffee and go - that is also fasting.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8108"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""547"" height=""433"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The kind of intermittent fasting, or IF, that has caught on in the dieting world is intentional intermittent fasting; setting fasting and feeding windows in your days to manage weight and renew a sense of control over eating habits. There are many reasons why intermittent fasting has been practiced for so long in both normal diets, and even in certain medical situations.</span><b>Why Do People Fast?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In an article by </span><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting#section9""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Healthline.com</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> they compiled a list of 10 evidence-based reasons for why people are trying intermittent fasting.

Some protocols even have subjects go up to 4 days without food, with 3 days a week the “refeed”.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The protocol that is most common among the everyday faster is a 16:8 - fasting:feasting plan. This means that you set an 8-hour window in your day where you can eat according to whatever diet you currently follow, and then fast for 16 hours. Common splits are 10-6, 12-8, and for some a 7-3 feasting window works best for them. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">No matter what you choose, if you are feeding yourself healthy and nutritious foods during those feasting windows, you are going to experience one, or many, or the health benefits associated with intermittent fasting.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-6.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-8110"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3-6-711x1024.jpg"" alt="""" width=""711"" height=""1024"" /></a><b>The Downside to Intermittent Fasting</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As with all trends, there are always reasons why you should be cautious before adopting a new practice. Intermittent fasting is not right for individuals who have wrestled with restrictive dieting practices that led to eating disorders. The point of IF is </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">not</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to starve yourself in an extreme way, it is simply controlled fasting to allow the body to reset and repair itself before eating again.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In a study with over 4,000 women with gallstone disease, it was discovered that long, overnight fasting can actually increase your risk of hospitalization. So if you are someone with gallstone disease, fasting is not the right option for you.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lastly, certain illnesses should not be tested by fasting. If your energy is already low because of a certain illness or disease, then it is not recommended to fast for extended periods of time.</span><b>Should You Try Intermittent Fasting?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As with all of our articles on the various dieting options out there, we cannot say one way or another if intermittent fasting is right for you. There are definitely some amazing benefits to intermittent fasting, but it is not for everyone. If you are curious about trying intermittent fasting, talk to your trainer, your doctor, or a registered nutrition professional for more information.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here are a few resources for you should you wish to investigate intermittent fasting further (articles are both for and against IF)</span><a href=""https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/5-reasons-to-avoid-intermittent-fasting""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">5 Reasons To Avoid Intermittent Fasting</span></a><a href=""https://www.health.com/nutrition/4-reasons-not-to-try-intermittent-fasting""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">4 Reasons Not To Try Intermittent Fasting</span></a><a href=""https://redefiningstrength.com/intermittent-fasting-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Intermittent Fasting - The Good, the Bad, the Ugly</span></a><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5064803/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Effects of 8-weeks of time restricted feeding (16/8) on basal metabolism, maximal strength, body composition, inflammation, and cardiovascular risk factors in resistance-trained males</span></a><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680567/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Intermittent Fasting: The Science of Going Without</span></a>

The CIBC Run for the Cure event is a leading fundraiser in Canada that brings people together from all over the country to help raise money for life-saving research that hopes to find a cure for breast cancer.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In Canada, breast cancer is the number one diagnosed cancer for women, with 26,300 new diagnoses and 5,000 deaths from it by the end of the year (</span><a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/chronic-diseases/cancer/breast-cancer.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2017 stat</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">). With statistics like these, nowadays it seems as though everyone knows someone who has been affected by breast cancer. This is why Free Form Fitness believes it is very important to support this cause by registering our own team. All members are welcome to join the team and we will have shirts on sale for $20 at all of our locations to help our team raise money for this amazing cause.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To get everyone excited about the event we want to give you some background on the event, the cause you will be supporting, and how you can help!</span><b>CIBC Run For The Cure Story</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The run began right here in our province of Ontario when a group of volunteers got together at High Park in Toronto. This first group of around 1500 people were able to raise $85,000 for breast cancer research. CIBC joined this movement in 1997 and the run has since then become the largest single day, volunteer-run event to raise awareness for breast cancer research in Canada. What started as 1500 volunteers in a park has turned into an event with over 10,000 participants raising over 17 million dollars a year!</span><b>Who does this support?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Above all else, participating in this event will support all of the women who have been and who will be diagnosed with breast cancer. The funds are put towards the most promising research projects that are looking for innovative ways to treat and cure breast cancer. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">CIBC Run for the Cure has partnered with the Canadian Cancer Society to ensure the money goes to the best recipients possible. To learn more about the Canadian Cancer Society, here is a short video on who they are and what they are working towards.</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/CDNCancerSociety""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">https://www.youtube.com/user/CDNCancerSociety</span></a><b>How Can You Help?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The CIBC Run for the Cure will be happening on September 30th. Throughout the month of September, Free Form Fitness will be selling special edition FFF t-shirts for $20. All proceeds from the t-shirt sales will be added to our team’s fundraising efforts.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pink.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8118"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/pink.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""452"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you would like to participate in the run, you can register with the Free Form Fitness team by following this link: </span><a href=""http://www.supportcbcf.com/goto/freeformfitness""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">http://www.supportcbcf.com/goto/freeformfitness</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Taking care of our community is what we at Free Form Fitness are all about.

42,Eggs: Friend or Foe?,https://freeformfitness.ca/eggs-friend-or-foe/,"Mon, 10 Sep 2018 00:07:46 +0000",admin,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8128,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eggs are the original superfood. They are low cost, nutrient dense, and incredible versatile being used in baking, breakfast items, and everything in between. They are also a source of cholesterol putting them on the “do-not-eat” list for all people with, or concerned about heart conditions. But are they really as bad as we may think? Alternatively, are they really all their cracked up to be? It is time to break down the hard-boiled facts about eggs and unscramble all of the information out there so you can start your day - sunny side up.</span><b>Egg - Our Friend</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eggs are an incredible food item. They are available globally and have no use restrictions by on religious grounds. They are a low cost food item, making them available to most populations at various socio-economic levels. Lastly, come packed with a plethora of essential nutrients including protein, monounsaturated fats, selenium, and magnesium.</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4303863/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In fact</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, despite the varying concentrations of these nutrients between different hens (environmental and nutritional factors change the eggs the hens lay), many of the nutrients found in eggs are the same nutrients that most individuals consuming a standard western diet are deficient in!</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/egg1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8129"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/egg1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""462"" height=""357"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The complexity of the nutrient profile within eggs is impressive. Not only do eggs provide a healthy dose of many nutrients we need for energy, hormone production, and brain development, they have also been found to have </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24235241""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">antioxidant and antimicrobial effects</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">! </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Remember our blog about getting enough sunshine to produce vitamin D, but not so much that you burn? Well eggs could help you enjoy the sun longer without getting a sunburn. A compound known as phosvitin, which is found in the yolk of eggs, acts a melanogenesis inhibitor. </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22953815/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Simply put</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: a compound found in egg yolks inhibits our melanin cells from overproducing pigmentation.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With so many health benefits, why do eggs have such a bad reputation?</span><b>Eggs - Our foe</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although eggs have an impressive amount of good nutritional qualities, there are a few red flags. Cholesterol is one of the nutrients found in eggs (about 200-300mg/100g of eggs). Research is unable to agree whether or not the consumption of cholesterol affects the serum cholesterol concentrations in the human body. In fact there have been a number of studies done on this very issue.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/egg2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8130"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/egg2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""509"" height=""337"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One study in </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18195171/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2008 </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">with over 21,000 US male participants found that consuming more than 1 egg per day led to increased risk of heart failure. Another study done 2 years earlier in </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17092383/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2006</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> looked at over 90,000 men and women between the ages of 40 and 50 living in Japan and found that consuming eggs daily was not correlated with an increase in cardiovascular heart disease or serum cholesterol concentrations. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The research continues to battle over whether or not eggs are good or bad for you, making it very difficult for consumers to decide whether or not they should include eggs in their diet. What research has been able to determine, which may help you decide whether eggs are worth it for you, is that the effect of dietary cholesterol on your body’s cholesterol levels is dependent on (but not limited to) a </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11023005""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">few factors</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">:</span><ul><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ethnicity</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Genetic makeup</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hormonal factors</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Body mass index</span></li></ul><b><i>Om-lette </i></b><b>you in on a secret</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Eggs are neither friend nor foe in a perfectly, distinguishable way. There are pros and cons to any food item. Eggs are our friend because they are cost effective, nutritionally dense, and can offer us antioxidant and antimicrobial effects. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yet eggs are also our foe because they continue to stump the researchers trying to determine if cholesterol or lecithin found in eggs are increasing our risk for cardiovascular disease. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As we always like to remind you in all of our nutrition-based blogs - moderation is key. If you choose to enjoy the benefits of eggs, be mindful and don’t overdo it. If you decide to limit the amount of eggs you consume - don’t limit yourself too much and miss out on some of the amazing benefits of eggs.</span>

43,Sugar: Are we all addicts?,https://freeformfitness.ca/sugar-are-we-all-addicts/,"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 23:29:35 +0000",admin,false,http://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8178,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Do ever feel like you have absolutely no control over your cravings for something sweet? Do you sometimes feel like unless you “treat yourself” to something soon, you’ll be low energy and low focus? Have you ever compared these feelings to those described when talking about mild </span><a href=""https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">withdrawal symptoms</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">? If you have found some similarities that’s because </span><a href=""https://abc13.com/health/study-sugar-is-as-addictive-as-cocaine/533979/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sugar is actually 8x more addictive than cocaine</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, a known addictive drug. So why can food companies get away with pumping our children’s cereals with sugar, and our government put the same tax on sweets as they do on health food items?</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This week we want to explain to you just how addictive sugar is, why companies continue to use it to get us to buy their products, and a few ways you can kick your sugar addiction.</span><b>Why Are We Addicted to Sugar?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If we think about the food sources that were available to humans prior to the industrial farming, GMO’s, and the globalization of food, our ancestors ate what they could find. Hunting, gathering, and foraging were how we kept ourselves alive and so our brains evolved systems that would motivate and reinforce the drive to hunt and forage.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sweet foods - any fruits and vegetables that we could find - were like little energy boosters. Something to give us enough energy and nutrients to survive the longer hauls between larger, more substantial meals. Our brains and bodies crave sugar when we need a boost. The simple consumption of something sweet jolts the whole system, giving us energy, and lighting up the reward centers in our brain making us feel so good.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sugar1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8146"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sugar1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""389"" height=""338"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So how does that translate to now? Well </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235907/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">researchers</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> have found that the brain functions that evolved to help keep us alive in the past is still present in our minds. Unfortunately we can now relate this function of the brain to humans susceptibility to addiction. Initially it was thought to only be linked to our addiction to psychoactive drugs, but not researchers are testing how this relates to food.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If this area of the brain causes addiction to consumed drugs, then it is also likely that we could experience </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27852970""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">addictions to foods </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">that we consume as well. Sugar is especially interesting to study because researchers have found that consuming sugar causes many of the same responses in the brain as drugs. There is a dopamine release, that makes us feel good, and then a release of a neurochemical acetylcholine, which acts as a messenger between nerve cells. </span><b>The Food Industry</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When the food industry caught wind of the fact that humans could become addicted to certain foods, it meant that they could create dependencies on their products, which would mean massive success for them. Foods became more processed and </span><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">manufactured to be highly palatable</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> so that you would crave more of these products.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the 70’s and 80’s when a study came out saying that </span><a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">high fat foods were the cause of</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> cardiovascular disease and metabolic conditions, the food industry took the fat out of the food, and replaced it with sugar. Removing the fat meant removing where most of the flavour was coming from, so they would add sugar and sugar substitutes to ensure people continued to buy their products.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sugar2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8147"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sugar2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""425"" height=""315"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It was after this shift in “understanding” that the rates of obesity started to increase rapidly. Cardiovascular disease and metabolic condition cases also </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158252""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">began to increase as well</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. This is because the study that was published to warn us all about the dangers of fatty foods, was actually a spun story funded by the sugar industry. </span><a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/sugar-harvard-conspiracy-1.3759582""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They paid</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to have the researchers switch their story from sugar being the culprit for food-related disease, and made fat our enemy.</span><b>So What Do We Do Now?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The fact that we have been manipulated to buy more of these foods is frustrating but understanding this also helps us to make better healthier decisions in the grocery store. Consuming sugar regularly actually creates a dependency in our brains. We are constantly looking for that rush of dopamine to feel good, whether we realize it or not.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sugae3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8149"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/sugae3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""407"" height=""325"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Kicking the sugar addiction is similar to kicking any other addiction. It will take time and perseverance through some very uncomfortable days. In a study where scientist created a sugar dependency in rats, when they took away the sugar the rates displayed binge eating behaviours when they were eventually given food and they displayed signs of depression and anxiety when the food was gone. So if you think that you are a slave to the sweets, here are a few ways you can kick your sugar addiction!</span>

&nbsp;
<ul><li><b>Know what you are up against<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">: Now that you know some of the symptoms you will experience when removing excess sugar from your diet, keep that in mind and remind yourself to stay strong. The feelings of anxiety, depression, and fatigue are all temporary as your body adjust to less sugar</span></b></li></ul><ul><li>Make sure you have a healthy diet:<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> If your body is going to feel deprived of sugar, you should make sure you are getting the most complete diet possible. All of your vitamins, minerals, and a healthy combination of fats, proteins and carbohydrates from whole food sources</span></li></ul><ul><li>Abstain until you feel ready:<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Liberating yourself from a sugar dependency means that “cheat-days” may not be an option for quite some time. The slightest reintroduction of sufficient amounts of sugar can put you right back into a state of sugar dependency. </span></li></ul>
&nbsp;

44,Is Fat Making Us Fat?,https://freeformfitness.ca/is-fat-making-us-fat/,"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 23:21:22 +0000",admin,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8185,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Over the past couple of weeks we have been looking into common diets like the Nordic and Ketogenic diet. Just last week we highlighted the fact that our society is addicted to sugar, all because the food industry blamed fats as a cause for cardiovascular disease. Because of this cover up we all lived by the simple dogma that fat makes you fat. Many products in the grocery store were modified to be low fat or completely non-fat. Our cheese of choice was light, and our mothers only served us skim milk, and yet, obesity has been on the rise since we were fed this big fat lie.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So what is happening here? Were we completely fed a handful of lies, or is there some truth to the last 40 years of food choices? This week we will be digging deeper into the idea that fat is making us fat.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8186"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""422"" height=""318"" /></a><b>What is fat?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fat as a fuel source, or macronutrient, is the most calorie dense of the macronutrients. 1g of fat provides 9kcals (Cals), in comparison to carbohydrates and proteins, which provide 4kcals per 1g. This means that you only have to eat half as much fats in order to yield the same energy as carbs or proteins. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fats are also crucial for the absorption of vitamins A, D, E and K. The fact that we were advised to limit our fats in the past is crazy knowing that we </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">need</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> fats in order to absorb such vital vitamins. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are 3 main types of fats that we see in most food items. Saturated fats, unsaturated fats, and trans fats. They are given these names based on their molecular structure. Saturated fats are made up of a chain of carbons of which each is bonded to a hydrogen or carbon atom by a single bond. Unsaturated fats have double bonds between 1 or more carbon atoms. Trans fats are an altered form of the unsaturated fats, and their molecular structure is achieved by synthetically hydrogenating the chain. Each configuration of these fatty acid chains gets broken down, or metabolized, by the body differently.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All of this mumbo-jumbo chemistry talk can be seen in the following image:</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8187"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""522"" height=""364"" /></a><b>Does fat makes us fat?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As was previously stated, each of these fats is broken down differently by the body. Without going into detail and boring you with more chemistry mumbo-jumbo, just know that the bonds between the carbons and the shape of the molecule, and how they molecules stack up against each other effect how they are broken down by the body. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is at this point that we need to change the question because what makes us fat is simply a surplus of calorie intake in comparison to our calorie expenditure. With that said, proteins and fats serve many other purposes besides energy production so when we consume these macronutrients they get put straight to work and are less likely to be stored as fat. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, provide us with energy. So if we do not need the energy, we simply store it in our body’s fat cells for another time.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I digress - back to the real question.</span><b>So if they aren’t making us fat, why are they so bad?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Specific types of fats have the potential to be detrimental to our health, if consumed in large quantities and in combination with a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, drinking, and stress. Trans fatty acids, or simply trans fats, have </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3955571/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">been shown</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to increase our bad cholesterol, LDL, and lower our good cholesterol, HDL. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8188"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""535"" height=""361"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yes, that’s right, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">good cholestrol</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. That is a topic for another blog. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So what about saturated and unsaturated fatty acids? Well it was long believed that the consumption of these would lead to an increase risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. More recent research has shown that this is not the case. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Saturated fatty acids have actually shown no </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">direct effect</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> on increasing your risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke, and combining saturated fatty acids with unsaturated fatty acids actually showed a 17% </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5475232/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">decrease</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in the risk for cardiovascular disease. With that said, saturated fats do affect the levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol, in our blood. So while researchers are not finding a direct increase in CVD risk, LDL is linked to risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, and therefore saturated fats on their own should be limited in your diet.Health Canada recommends that you keep saturated and trans fats as low as possible, while maintaining healthy levels of mono- and polyunsaturated fats. A few examples of these are nuts and seeds, fatty fish, avocados, vegetable oils. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/4.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8189"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""535"" height=""308"" /></a><b>So Fat Doesn’t Make me Fat, but Trans Fats and Saturated Fats Just Makes Me Sick?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Research has shown that fats when consumed in combination with carbohydrates leads to </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4856550/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">unfavourable body composition</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. So fats alone are not contributing to weight gain, it is more about what you are eating your fats with. Other factors such as genetics and insulin sensitivity will also determine the effect of this combination of macronutrients. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If there was one clear culprit for what has caused the increase in obesity and cardiovascular disease in the last 30 to 40 years, it would be easy to deal with that issue. Unfortunately there are many other factors that lead to weight gain and cardiovascular disease, so trans fats, saturated fats, and carbohydrates cannot take all the blame. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">While we all digest this reality, why not check out a few great resources on fats!</span><a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/nutrients/fats.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Health Canada Article on Fats</span></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvvx2yQRbzQ""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Deal with Fat - Sci Show</span></a><a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/trans-fats-health-heart-disease-canada-1.4824852""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Canada’s Trans Fat Ban Comes Into Effect - CBC</span></a>",,8185,2018-09-24 19:21:22,2018-09-24 23:21:22,closed,open,is-fat-making-us-fat,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,8189,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1594932943,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Is Fat Making Us Fat? | Effective Weight Loss Now,,https://effective-weight-lossnow.info/is-fat-making-us-fat/,192.185.2.78,2018-12-06 17:40:56,2018-12-06 22:40:56,[&#8230;] Is Fat Making Us Fat?

Driving down streets you may have driven your whole life you will notice new strip-malls, banks, restaurants, and the widening of roadways. Suburbs and cities continue to encroach upon farmland and when building out isn’t an option, we build up, with high rise apartment buildings and condos.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8201"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""625"" height=""416"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have you ever thought about how this urbanization is affecting your health? So much to look at, so many sounds, new smells, and way more people creates a constant state of sensory overload. This overwhelming and persistent stimulation is one of the many reasons why those of us living in cities have higher levels of stress, suffer from high blood pressure, and experience more of the negative and hostile emotions when interacting </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2738359/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">with our peers.</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thankfully, there is an incredibly easy way to mitigate these symptoms. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the 1980’s the Japanese government was looking for a way to manage the increasing levels of stress and stress-related disease amongst its population. </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28788101""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shinrin-Yoku</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, or </span><a href=""http://time.com/5259602/japanese-forest-bathing/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Forest Bathing</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">was a medical treatment that had been practiced by doctors across eastern Asia and seemed like a promising option. The government implemented research projects investigating the healing effects of forest bathing, and eventually made Shinrin-Yoku a health program.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8202"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/2-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""540"" height=""350"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since the 80’s, forest bathing has become a popular topic for researchers in the field of stress management and cardiovascular health. What they have found is that a simple 2 hour forest bathing session has a </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579495/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">number of benefits</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. These include lowering heart rate, lowering blood pressure, decreasing stress, increasing positive emotions and clearing the mind for more open and creative thinking. Even more interesting is the fact that trees give off an essential oil called </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">phytoncide</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that protects them from disease. Breathing in the </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20074458""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">phytoncide helps to increase the number of natural killer cells (NK Cells)</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, which are responsible for protecting our bodies from diseases like cancer.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8203"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""622"" height=""328"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Nature therapy, as it is sometimes referred to as, takes a few hours of your time and nothing else. Studies have actually shown that just by looking at images of nature, pulse rate begins to decrease, and you become more relaxed. For a true Shinrin-Yoku experience you simply immerse yourself in nature, without any outside electronics or devices, so that you can truly take in everything that nature has to offer. The smell of the wood and the flowers; the sounds of birds singing and leaves rustling; the feel of the ground beneath your feet; each bringing you closer and closer to the more natural world, and farther away from the stresses of urban life.</span>

New research has recently come out saying that it is not so simple.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This probably comes as no surprise to many of you. We have all had that one friend who tries a new diet and it works perfectly for them, and yet when we try it, we see no results or somehow manage to gain weight! The research is now adding a new step to our old formula for weight loss.</span><b>Calories in + the right gut microbiota + calories out = weight loss.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The gut microbiome is a greatly neglected part of our overall health. The little bacteria that live throughout our gastrointestinal tract have an effect on our immune system, our skin health, and our digestion. Now researchers </span><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo2017220?foxtrotcallback=true""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">are discovering</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that they can also be why you can or cannot lose weight.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having the “right” ratio of specific microbiota has </span><a href=""https://www.livestrong.com/article/13580676-not-losing-weight-the-answer-may-be-in-your-poop/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">been </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">observed to be critical for weight loss. A recent study looked at the stool samples of individuals on the New Nordic Diet (high fiber), and a standard Danish diet (high protein &amp; fat). It found that people were only successful at losing weight </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">if</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> they had higher </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Prevotella bacteria to Bacteroide bacteria</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. If they didn’t have the right ratio they saw little to no weight loss, despite the fact that they were on a diet. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An interesting fact on these two different kinds of gut microbiota: bacteroides are found in larger quantities in the stool samples of individuals from North America, while prevotella are in abundance in the stool samples of individuals who are non-North American. Bacteroides feed on things like fatty foods and meat, while prevotella feeds on high fiber fruits and vegetables.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8213"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""642"" height=""384"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The gut microbiome, the interwoven workings of the various bacteria living throughout our gastrointestinal tract, is incredibly complex. There are many different </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">genera</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of gut bacteria, each with its own role in the body. For the sake of this article, we will focus on the two observed in </span><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/ijo2017220?foxtrotcallback=true""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">the study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> mentioned at the beginning of the article.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To summarize, individuals were fed 2 diets: 1 high fiber diet, and one high fat and protein diet. The individuals who had a high prevotella : bacteroides ratio saw results on both diets. Individuals with a low prevotella : bacteroides saw little to no change. This would suggest that a high prevotella concentration in the gut will set us up for success when we would like to lose weight. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Unfortunately the standard american diet, or SAD, typically does not include the kinds of foods that feed the prevotella bacteria. These little </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5679392/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">gut bugs feed on high fiber foods</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and the only way to ensure we have an abundance of them is to feed them those types of food.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8214"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""539"" height=""361"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Gut microbiota primarily exists in the intestines. Here most of the simple carbohydrates like mono- and disaccharides like fructose (fruit sugar), galactose (dairy sugars), glucose (table sugar), maltose (cereals, barley) have already been absorbed earlier on in the digestive system. All that is left to feed on are the more </span><a href=""http://www.ivyroses.com/HumanBiology/Nutrition/Types-of-Sugar.php""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">complex molecules</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> like those found in high fiber foods, or proteins and fats. Prevotella likes the oligo- and polysaccharides found in starchy carbs like potatoes, certains plants like asparagus, artichokes and other “roughage”.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So if we are eating diets that are composed of highly processed and refined foods we will be </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5339271/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">increasing our number of bacteroides</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and leaving our prevotella to starve. </span><b>Other Bonuses to Healthy Gut Microbiome</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The bacteria in our gut are developed very early on. In fact, the </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5453967/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">bacteroides begin to populate</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in large numbers when we are babies and are feeding on breast milk or formula. Building up our bacteroide colonies is crucial to developing a strong immune system. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yes - we did just say that bacteroides are beneficial as well! </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The important thing to remember from the ratio study is that it is a ratio. Yes, we need to build up higher quantities of the prevotella bacteria, but we also must maintain a population of bacteroides so that we have a flourishing gut microbiome. Right now many of our weight problems are caused by an unhealthy imbalance of microbiota due to our diet that is high in simple carbs, overly processed and refined foods.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8215"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""343"" height=""234"" /></a><b>What You Can Do Now</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The best way to benefit from this knowledge is to start putting it into practice.

If you don’t think you are getting enough from those sources, there are also a number of vitamin C supplements out there, as well as fortified foods to help you get your recommended dose of vitamin C.</p><p dir=""ltr"">How much is the <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/"" data-cke-saved-href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/"">daily recommended dose</a>?

For adult females you want to try and get 65-75mg/day, unless you are pregnant or lactating, where you would need 80-85mg/day and 115-120mg/day, respectively. If you are a smoker you actually need 35mg more vitamin C than your non-smoking counterparts do.</p><p dir=""ltr"">What Happens if you don’t get enough Vitamin C?</p><p dir=""ltr"">I am sure we all remember from our high school history books that those brave explorers who sailed across the ocean didn’t always make it to North America in the best of health. Fruit was hard to keep fresh, so the crew of the ships were unable to get their daily recommended amount of vitamin C. This led to an unfortunate disease called scurvy.</p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493187/"" data-cke-saved-href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493187/"">Scurvy</a> sets in after about a month with little to no vitamin C intake. It starts with fatigue and the swelling of gums, and progressively gets worse with tissues becoming weak and loosened due to poor collagen production. Healing is impaired and depression begins to set in. Eventually the gums and teeth begin to fall out and bleed. Vitamin C also plays a crucial role in iron absorption, so anemia is another symptom of extreme vitamin C deficiency.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Vitamin C deficiency is characterized as consuming less than 10mg/day.</p><p dir=""ltr"">So be sure to eat your citrus fruits and bell peppers so you don’t suffer the same fate as those early explorers!</p>",,8309,2018-10-15 17:34:58,2018-10-15 21:34:58,closed,open,cancer-fighting-vitamin-c,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_edit_last,5,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,_thumbnail_id,8311,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1594967281,shared_counts_total,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,What is Reverse Dieting?,https://freeformfitness.ca/what-is-reverse-dieting/,"Sun, 21 Oct 2018 18:17:58 +0000",admin,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8336,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have you ever thought about how restricting calories could be a stimulus for the body? The simple act of dieting causes the body to make adaptations so it can handle fewer calories better. This is partially why we end up losing weight and our appetite changes when we diet. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is also why when the diet stops, many of us find ourselves back at our original weight. This week we take a look at how calorie restrictive diets are affecting us on a biological level, and how a concept known as </span><b>reverse dieting</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> could help us avoid ever dieting again.</span><b>Why prolonged calorie deficit is bad</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our bodies have an incredible way of keeping us alive. There are systems and processes built into our biology that protect us from dying without us even realizing. The immune system is an obvious example of this. Our fight or flight response is another great example of how the body will do whatever it takes to help us survive. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dieting, more often than not, refers to the restriction of calories. Restricting our bodies from the one thing that gives us the energy to complete many of these survival functions forces the metabolism to adapt accordingly. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If we feed it less energy, the metabolism slows down - make it work less because we are consuming less. This is all well and good when we are </span><b>following the diet.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ever heard of The Biggest Loser? This famous show took obese individuals, brought them to The Biggest Loser Ranch, and put them through a 30-week weight loss program with regular, televised weigh-ins, nutrition challenges, and incredibly difficult workouts. The finale was always really impressive, juxtaposing the contestants current bodies against an old, much larger pair of pants.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8337"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""628"" height=""242"" /></a><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Retrieved from the New York Times Article: “</span></i><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/02/health/biggest-loser-weight-loss.html""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After ‘The Biggest Loser,’ Their Bodies Fought to Regain Weight”</span></i></a></p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After the show was over and the coaches were gone and the contestants were brought back to their normal lives, they would gain most, if not all, of the weight back. A team of </span><a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.21538""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">researchers recently looked </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">into The Biggest Loser and its season 8 contestants and discovered a few possible explanations for this.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What they found was that the resting metabolic rate (the calories required to sit on a couch and stay alive) of the contestants slowed way down at the 30th week of the program on the show. This makes sense as they usually restricted their calories to about 1200 kcals per day. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">After 6 years the contestant’s resting metabolic rate did climb, but not to the rate it was prior to the show. So although many of them returned to their previous weight, they now were burning fewer calories throughout the day.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8338"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""651"" height=""376"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Researchers also found that the leptin levels, a hormone that signals satiety and is linked to fat mass, did return to “normal” levels after the show. Although the leptin returned, the participant’s likely, and potentially unconsciously, returned to old eating habits.  Although their leptin levels rose in unison with their fat mass, their resting metabolic rate was still less than before. This could be one of the explanations for their weight gain.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8339"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""641"" height=""394"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How does this apply to those of us who are not on The Biggest Loser? We need to understand how calorie restrictive diets change our bodies </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">on the inside</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Knowing that our metabolisms are slowing down as a form of adaptation is key here. Does all of this mean that we are doomed to a lifetime of dieting and regaining the weight back? </span><b>Not necessarily.</b><b>How to reverse diet</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The key here is that our metabolism </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">adapts. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If we can manipulate our bodies ability to adapt, then we may be able to protect ourselves from post-diet weight gain.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the physique and bodybuilding community they know calorie restriction all too well. In order to get stage-ready many of them restrict their calories extensively to get as lean and cut as possible. After competition many of these athletes experience a post-competition weight gain. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8340"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""675"" height=""304"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In order to control the weight gain and retrain their metabolism some of them have taken on a refeeding regime known as reverse dieting. </span><a href=""https://breakingmuscle.com/healthy-eating/reverse-dieting-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-try-it""><b>Reverse dieting</b></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is the systematic reintroduction of calories into the diet to repair the metabolism and encourage metabolic adaptation that will lead to a more sustainable daily caloric intake.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Emphasis on the word ‘systematic’. Reverse dieting can be more tedious than prep dieting. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First you need to know how many calories you are eating, on average, per day. Tracking these meticulously over about 1-2 weeks is necessary prior to starting reverse dieting. Once you know how much you are consuming per day, then you need to get comfortable weighing yourself regularly. (Check out</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/best-apps-for-fitness/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> this blog</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> for fitness tracking app options)</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Every week or so you will reintroduce 100-</span><a href=""https://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-200-calories-look-like.htm""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">200 calories per day</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Weighing yourself regularly is essential here because you want to watch as your weight goes up, and then stabilizes again. Once your weight stabilizes, then you can introduce another 100-200 calories. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Minor weight gain will occur throughout this process so it is important to choose an amount that you are comfortable with gaining before you start this whole process. After all, gaining a small amount of weight is much better than either continuing to live in a calorie deficit, or gaining weight in an uncontrolled manner.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This slow incorporation of calories over time gives your metabolism time to adapt and realize that you are no longer in starvation mode. It will slowly but surely increase to a point where you can be eating closer to 2000 calories a day and are still lean. </span><b>Who it benefits</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reverse dieting is a meticulous process. It requires prudent food tracking, frequent weigh-ins where you may see the number on the scale rise, and above all else - </span><b>patience</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We live in a world where we can have so many things immediately. You’ll have to fight that mentality through this. Reverse dieting will be especially challenge for those of us who associate the number on the scale going up as a bad thing. In this situation seeing it rise and fall is a healthy part of the process. It may be difficult at first, but over time you will establish a new and healthier approach to the number on the scale.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is why reverse dieting is best used for individuals who are ready and open to see a little bit of weight gain for a </span><b>major metabolic and lifestyle benefit</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reverse dieting is also best suited for individuals coming off of competitions, people who have been in a calorie deficit for many years (through diets, or simply not eating enough), and for those who are at a healthy weight, but feel they are strapped for calories.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/5.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8341"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""660"" height=""254"" /></a><b>Resources</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Want to learn more about reverse dieting?

Within our very own Free Form Fitness family we have members who are currently living with this disease. About a year ago we profiled Elianna Saidenberg, a doctor, mother, wife, and client of our Wellington Village location. Elianna had been working out at the Wellington Village gym for years, having worked with many trainers when in March of 2015 she was diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer. You can read the original profile </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/battling-cancer-fitness-family/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">here</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fast forward to now and Dr. Saidenberg is an inspiration to the entire Free Form Fitness team. She has been training with Vania for the last 5 years and the two have worked together to modify her program as her health status has changed. When asked about how Vania approached her training program, Vania had this to say:</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">“</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When Elianna was initially diagnosed in 2015, she took about 6 months off. I believe she had 2 major surgeries during this time off. Once she came back, we </span><b>kept things simple</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and focused on getting her moving again. We worked on rebuilding her core strength as both surgeries involved going through her abdominal wall. Since we had already been training together for so long, there wasn't as much instructing to do on my part. It was more gauging what her energy levels were like that day and adjusting from there. We were able to get her strength levels pretty close to where she was at prior to her cancer diagnosis when she began her first round of chemo.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8356"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""639"" height=""310"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">During chemo, we tried to maintain her strength as much as possible. I had to be flexible, depending on how she felt. I'd change an exercise if she was feeling too sore in a particular area. I also wasn't afraid to push her a little bit if I saw that she had good energy on a particular day. Elianna also had a great understanding of her own limitations, so she was able to tell me whether she could lift a heavier weight or ease back. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having an established relationship made things easier on my part because I knew which exercises she was good at and which ones she liked. I was able to alter the plan a little easier that way. “</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At Free Form Fitness, we may not have </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">all</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of the answers and we certainly cannot cure cancer.

Without adequate amounts of vitamin D in our body, we are unable to absorb calcium. Vitamin D also blocks, or inhibits, the release of parathyroid hormone which </span><a href=""https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/15050-vitamin-d--vitamin-d-deficiency""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">absorbs bone tissue.</span></a><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15018485""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Calcium</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is a mineral that is required to maintain bone health all through life, so ensuring our body can actually absorb this nutrient is an integral part our long-term health. Prolonged vitamin D deficiency can lead to brittle bones and increased risk of falls in the elderly.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are </span><a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/10/181030091449.htm""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">new studies </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">emerging that propose other beneficial functions of vitamin D in the body, but they are still in their early stages. </span><b>Where Do We Get It?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The most obvious (and free) source of Vitamin D is the sun. The sun’s UVB rays interact with a common cholesterol in our skin cells and a pre-vitamin D chemical. This reaction creates vitamin D3, which is then transported to the liver where it goes through a number of chemical changes before becoming the usable form of vitamin D.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Depending on skin tone, </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356951/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">humans produce</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> from 8, 000IU’s of vitamin to 50,000IU’s from just 30 minutes of exposure to midday sun.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For those of us living 37 degrees north or south of the equator, the amount of vitamin D we produce naturally decreases as we move into the winter months. The power of the sun’s rays change at different angles (</span><a href=""https://g.co/kgs/eRkL7L""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">zenith angle</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">), so 30 minutes of midday, winter sun will not produce the same amount of vitamin D as midday, summer sun.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is why we are often encouraged to consume a vitamin D3 supplement through the winter months. Research shows that the vitamin D we build up in the summer months is stockpiled, but these stores become depleted, which is why taking a supplement is recommended.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vitamin D that we get in liquid or pill form is usually from the oils of </span><a href=""https://www.consumerlab.com/answers/which-source-of-vitamin-d3-is-better-from-lanolin-in-sheeps-wool-or-from-fish-oil/vitamin-D-source-lanolin/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fatty fish</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, or the </span><a href=""https://vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/what-do-sheep-have-to-do-with-vitamin-d-supplements-quite-a-bit-actually-mates""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">wool of sheep</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.

Some argue that there is significantly less </span><a href=""https://examine.com/supplements/hemp-protein/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">lysine compared to other amino acids</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, which puts the quality of this protein into question.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A serving of hemp protein also contain about 15g of protein per serving. This is about 10g - 15g less than most protein powders, but hemp protein is much less refined. So if you prefer less refinement, and the protein content is less of an issue, then hemp protein may be a good option for you.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another benefit of hemp protein powder is the cost. </span><a href=""https://www.google.ca/search?ei=CM7mW6EZpeOPBLr6suAJ&amp;q=average+cost+of+hemp+protein+supplement&amp;oq=average+cost+of+hemp+protein+supplement&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...643350.645562.0.645897.15.15.0.0.0.0.126.1215.6j6.12.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..8.1.104...33i10k1.0.uR9Wu53yinA""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A quick search of the average cost of hemp</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> protein powder shows that this supplement can range from about $20 - $30 CAD. Generally vegan protein powders cost anywhere between $25 to upwards of $50. </span><b>Collagen Peptides</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second protein supplement that has been on the rise lately is collagen peptide protein powder. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collagen peptides are taken from the the bones and skin of animals and refined into powders for our consumption. As animals, we also have collagen in our bodies. This protein is actually the </span><a href=""https://www.wellandgood.com/good-food/collagen-protein-powder-workout/slide/2/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">most abundant protein in the human body</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, comprising around one third of the body’s protein. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8434"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""688"" height=""729"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collagen is fibrous and found in the bones, skin, and teeth.

Collagen only has 8 of the 9. Similarly to how hemp protein powder had an unbalanced distribution of amino acids, collagen’s distribution of amino acids leans heavily on glysine, proline, and hydroxyproline.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/4.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8436"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""481"" height=""506"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Similarly to the hemp protein, the amount of protein you will get in a collagen peptide protein supplement will be slightly less than that of the more traditional protein powders. Most have about 15g - 20g of protein per serving. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although collagen peptides may not have all of the amino acids as their more traditional protein powder counterparts, they do have other benefits. As we age, our body’s ability to produce collagen naturally begins to decrease, so taking it in supplement form has already been done to help those who develop joints pains and weakness as they age. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With that said, </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594048/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">one study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> showed that older men with </span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcopenia""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sarcopenia</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> who trained 3x/week for 3 months and took a collagen protein supplement showed improved strength and increased fat free mass (more muscle). It was discussed in this study that collagen peptide supplementation provided the protein required for protein synthesis post-workout, but that the pain-managing effects of the collagen could have also made it easier for the men to workout comfortably. Completing more of the prescribed workouts means a greater potential for adaptation.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8437"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""563"" height=""371"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collagen peptides are not nearly as inexpensive as hemp, but they are still not as expensive as the higher end whey and vegan protein powders. These products range from about $30 - $60.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So should you throw out your favourite whey or vegan protein? Maybe not just yet. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although hemp and collagen peptides come with their own benefits like being less refined, and improving the health of our skin and joints, if you are looking for larger amounts of protein per serving, these just don’t have that in a single serving. Their price point may be better than some of the protein powders on the market, but they also do have the balanced amino acid profile that we can expect from mainstream protein powders.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Collagen peptides are a great alternative for those who find that dairy-based proteins cause side effects due to sensitivities to dairy products. Especially if you find that plant based proteins are grainy, and do not taste great, collagen peptides are usually flavourless and dissolve very easily in liquids.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hemp is a great vegan option for anyone who has experienced unfavourable side effects from their current vegan protein powder, or who are simply looking to change up their protein source.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As with all of the supplement or dietary blogs we write for the Free Form Fitness blog they are here to simply educate you more on the current trends. If you think that one of these two proteins could benefit you and your healthy lifestyle, then continue the research and find what works for you. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Remember that protein supplements are just that - a supplement to the diet. Always aim to get protein from whole food sources like poultry, fish, or plant-based options. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3-1.jpg""> </a>

As a woman moves through the various stages of life from childhood, through puberty, to her child-bearing years and then finally into menopause, estrogen changes significantly. These changes not only lead to changes in her ability to conceive, but can also have profound effects on her body composition.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Estrogen is a highly active hormone in the hypothalamus, an area of the brain with many regulatory functions. Because it is so closely linked to this, its effects go far beyond a woman’s menstrual cycles. Via research into the potential uses of exogenous (made outside of the body) estrogen to help with menopause symptoms, scientists have discovered that estrogen interacts with leptin, and insulin, both of which are important hormones for metabolism and body composition.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How extensive are the effects of estrogen on a woman’s overall body composition?

Body hair is more fine on a woman, and the hair on their heads is more permanent thanks to estrogen. Women’s voice boxes are smaller due to estrogen, and lowers the activity of glands in the skin that produce oily substances, making it less likely for woman to have acne.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Apart from the female characteristics, </span><a href=""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/277177.php""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">estrogen interacts</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> with the chemicals and receptors in the brain to control temperature, and enhance the effects of feel-good neurotransmitters like serotonin.

This research also shows that there are hazardous side effects like cancer and clotting, and so it is controversial to recommend this as a solution to mitigate the effects of menopause. For the purpose of the Free Form Fitness blog, we want to highlight how exercise can actually prepare your body to handle the hormonal changes through life.</span><b>Estrogen and Exercise</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In a study published in the Physiological Reports Journal in 2015, they observed that exercise was an adequate supplementation for hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. This is due in part because </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4673645/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">exercise is a great way to control insulin</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Prior to menopause, regular exercise and a healthy diet are your safest bet to increase your chances of maintaining a healthy organs and body composition post menopause. Getting in shape is much easier prior to menopause because women are still producing normal amounts of estrogen and testosterone (yes women produce testosterone too). </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">WIth that said, getting in shape post-menopause is not impossible, it will just take a little longer than it would have in your earlier years. Exercising post menopause is a great idea not only because it will lead to a healthier body composition, but also because </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19657790""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">exercise has been shown to have a protective effect on the liver from fatty tissue accumulation</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">No matter where you are in your life cycle as a woman, weight bearing exercises to strengthen your muscles and protect your bones and connective tissue is always a good thing. Make sure you do your research or work with a trained professional prior to lifting weights to learn proper lifting technique.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/4-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8452"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/4-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""749"" height=""501"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Women should also take care of the heart health with regular cardio-type activities. As stated previously, as we age and our estrogen levels begin to decline, the protective effect of estrogen on the arteries declines as well. Just 30 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous physical activity is a great way to strengthen the heart and arteries. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The cycling of female hormones means that energy levels, self-esteem, and cravings are always fluctuating. What most of the research shows is that exercise and a balanced, low-sugar diet are women’s best way to boost mental clarity, keep body composition healthy, and help them live a long, happy, and healthy life.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For a quick breakdown of how hormones change throughout the life of a woman, </span><a href=""https://www.marieclaire.com/health-fitness/advice/a2853/female-hormones-cycle/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">check out this great article from Marie Claire.</span></a>",,8447,2018-11-19 18:10:16,2018-11-19 23:10:16,closed,open,how-estrogen-is-affecting-your-health,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,8448,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,1,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595245365,shared_counts_total,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,How Estrogen is Affecting Your Health | Effective Weight Loss Now,,https://effective-weight-lossnow.info/how-estrogen-is-affecting-your-health/,192.185.2.78,2018-12-06 13:21:45,2018-12-06 18:21:45,[&#8230;] How Estrogen is Affecting Your Health [&#8230;],0,pingback,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Testosterone boosters, or Test boosters, claim to help boost testosterone, allowing men to experience the effects of testosterone in a greater scale. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Testosterone is a </span><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health/low-testosterone/effects-on-body#4""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">powerful hormone</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. It is an anabolic steroid in the body meaning it promotes the building of tissues in the body. More specifically, testosterone helps men put on lean muscle mass and burn fat more effectively. Testosterone also keeps bones healthy by helping to maintain healthy bone density.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/tumblr_mc7c29WeLT1rozjsuo1_500.gif""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8493"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/tumblr_mc7c29WeLT1rozjsuo1_500.gif"" alt="""" width=""425"" height=""239"" /></a><b>Why Take a test Booster?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Because this hormone is so powerful and useful towards performance in and out of the gym, it is pretty obvious why men would want a boost. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8494"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""615"" height=""434"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is a deeper issue with this though. Unfortunately there are men out there who look to hormone therapy and test boosters because of persistent low testosterone. In fact, 19-39% of men have low testosterone levels. This can be problematic if it begins at a young age, as testosterone levels really begin to drop off after the age of 30.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are a few biological reasons why a man will have low testosterone, but there are also environmental factors that can be managed to ensure men are not lowering their test levels more.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Obesity plays a large part in low testosterone levels as it can affect the production of the hormone. Managing weight through diet and exercise is a great way to avoid low testosterone levels.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8495"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""614"" height=""411"" /></a>

&nbsp;

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Opioid and steroid medications can also lower test levels because they interact with the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which is where the signal to produce testosterone comes from.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the same way that prolonged, high stress can cause a woman’s reproductive system to temporarily shut down, when a man is under high stress for a long period of time, he too can experience a reproductive shut down. </span><b>Have no fear - test boosters are here!</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8496"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""535"" height=""405"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But do we really need them/do they even work?</span><a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/do-testosterone-boosters-really-work.html""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Simple answer - not really</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Unless you are undergoing supervised hormone therapy, most - if not all - test boosters on the market will not have a significant effect. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many of the test boosters include zinc, magnesium aspartate, and monomethionine aspartate, or ZMA. These nutrients are depleted during exercise, and if not consumed or supplemented afterward can lead to low test levels. I</span><a href=""https://www.asep.org/asep/asep/BrillaV2.PDF""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">n a placebo-controlled study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, 27 athletes were given ZMA during a 7-week training program. Although their levels of testosterone were 30% higher than those who were on the placebo, the higher testosterone levels were not sustained. </span><b>Natural Testosterone Boosters</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Okay so you aren’t a candidate for hormone therapy, and you don’t want to spend money on a test booster (that likely won’t work), what can you do to </span><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health/low-testosterone/natural-boosters#sleep""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">boost your test naturally</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">?</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8497"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""493"" height=""477"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As mentioned before, obesity can be a factor in why testosterone levels are low. Get yourself exercising and eating a healthy diet and as the pounds go down, your test will go up!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Speaking of diet - ensuring you have enough zinc in your diet can also help keep test levels high. While you’re at it, make sure to watch your sugar intake. Sugar can decrease testosterone levels by as much a 25%! So best to keep that as low as possible if you want to keep your testosterone levels high. Consuming </span><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health/low-testosterone/boosting-food""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">animals products</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is also very important in maintaining healthy levels of testosterone. Animals products contain high levels of vitamin D and zinc, both of which are important in maintaining healthy levels of testosterone.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Last but not least, make sure you are getting enough good quality sleep. Prolonged lack of sleep can lead to not only decreased testosterone levels, but also a general low sense of wellbeing. So make sure you are getting at least 7 hours of sleep most nights.</span>

56,Why Women Gain Weight When They Start Exercising,https://freeformfitness.ca/why-women-gain-weight-when-they-start-exercising/,"Mon, 17 Dec 2018 22:17:55 +0000",admin,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8515,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So you’ve decided to start working out and eating a more balanced diet. You make it to the gym even on the days you don’t want to be there, you choose the side salad instead of the fries, and you have really up-ed your water game. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A few weeks in you wake up feeling great and decide it is time to step on the scale. To your dismay, you have actually </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">gained </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">weight! </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8516"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""951"" height=""539"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How could this be possible when you are doing everything right? Is the pain of the workouts and the resisting of temptations really worth it if your weight is just going to go up?</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Yes - definitely, 100% </span><b>yes</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. This weight gain after starting a new exercise routine and changing your eating habits is actually very common, and it is especially common in women due to shifts in our hormones when we start exercising.</span><b>Why the weight gain?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We have spoken many times about the body’s ability to adapt to new stressors. Exercise is definitely a new stressor, or stimulus, that the body must adapt to. These adaptations are what will eventually lead to increased strength, increased bone density, healthy body composition, and improved cardiovascular health. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When you first begin to exercise, your body has a few ways that it adapts. The first is via micro-tearing in the muscles. These micro-tears, or micro-trauma, are perfectly normal. These tiny tears in the muscle tissue become the sites for repair and recovery. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the process of repairing these microtears,  inflammation in the body increases around the sites of the microtears. Inflammation can cause the body to feel “puffy” and be the cause of a larger number on the scale.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8517"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""785"" height=""526"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your muscles will also be going through quite a bit of fuel while exercising, as well as the  recovery process. The muscle’s source of energy is glycogen, the stored form of glucose. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In order to deal with the increased demand for energy, the body will store glycogen in the muscles. Glycogen requires water in order to be stored in the muscle cells, and so some of the initial weight gain when you begin exercising can be attributed to water weight gain in order to manage the new energy demands for the muscle.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As for that diet - decreasing your caloric intake by </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">too</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> much can lower the metabolism. This sets your new baseline for caloric expenditure much lower, meaning you’d have to restrict your calories even more to see any weight loss from dietary changes.</span><b>Patience will pay off</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8518"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""701"" height=""527"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All of this should hopefully help to reinforce the idea that any change that is worth it will take time. Rome wasn’t built in a day, so take your time and be patient with your new workout routine. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The inflammation and water weight should begin to level off and decrease after 3-5 weeks of regular exercise, so don’t worry about the number on the scale until 2 months into your fitness journey. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Stay consistent and celebrate your consistency along the way. Make sure your nutrition fuels you, instead of leaving your feeling depleted and deprived. If you keep working away at improving your health every day, those small actions will add up to big change.</span>",,8515,2018-12-17 17:17:55,2018-12-17 22:17:55,closed,open,why-women-gain-weight-when-they-start-exercising,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,8516,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,90,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,shared_counts_datetime,1594986677,shared_counts_total,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57,Christmas Cravings (And How to Stay in Control),https://freeformfitness.ca/christmas-cravings-and-how-to-stay-in-control/,"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 19:10:33 +0000",admin,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8525,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Christmas is here and so are all of the incredible baked goods and tasty treats. This time of year can be especially tempting with </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">so much</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> on offer and messages on every sign, commercial, and storefront telling you to “Treat yourself” and “indulge”.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Part of a healthy lifestyle is balance and moderation, so for our special holiday blog we are prepared to help you manage your Christmas cravings, and not let the indulgences become over-indulgences.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8526"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""400"" /></a><b>First, let’s talk about sugar cravings.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A lot of holiday baking is centered around sweets. As you should know, eating too many sweets can leave you feeling bloated, inflamed, overstuffed, and guilty. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When sweets are presented to you this holiday season, try to pick your favourite, and tell yourself you can enjoy and savour 1 or 2. Giving yourself permission to enjoy what you really want will help you feel like you are not restricting yourself too much.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8527"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""671"" height=""446"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having 1 or 2 of these treats will definitely give you more sugar than you need to be consuming on any given day, but these are the holidays and so if a sacrifice must be made, then so be it.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With that said, many people see the week from Christmas to New Years as a free-for-all. This mentality needs to be avoided. On Christmas day there will be indulgences, but come boxing day, everything should go back to normal. Eat the way you were before Christmas and continue on with your healthy lifestyle. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Try to avoid the boxing day guilt trip, which leaves you feeling like you committed a mortal sin by enjoying treats the day before. Crash dieting or over exercising the next will only add stress to your life and will further encourage an unhealthy relationship with food and exercise.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As a final point on sugar cravings, understand that the more you indulge in sweets, the harder it will be to avoid them the following few days.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is because when you have a lot of sugar, it spikes your insulin, gives your brain a ton of glucose to run off of, and temporarily gives you a dopamine boost. When you are done burning through those sweets, you brain and body will crave that feeling again, making it seem impossible to say to sweets for the following few days.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8528"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1007"" height=""745"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Get ahead of this by having meals composed of healthy fats and proteins prepared for the rest of the week (hello turkey leftovers!). Drink lots of water, and remind yourself that if you give in, it will only make it harder to say no the next time.</span><b>Curb those cravings</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When our body craves certain food it can actually be a sign of something else. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dehydration has been shown to play tricks on the mind. When you are dehydrated your brain will misinterpret signals from the body and make you feel hungry, or agitated, or tired, when really all you need is a big glass of water. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Try having 1L of water for every 50lbs of body weight. </span><b>How Balanced is your Diet?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Cravings can be a symptom of nutrient deficiencies as well. Over the holidays it is so easy to miss out on important nutrients because we are eating a lot of the same thing, or we aren’t eating enough because we are running around to parties, and shopping malls, all while we try to get our work done before the holiday break.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/5.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8529"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""666"" height=""753"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A quick tip to ensure you are getting enough of the right nutrients in your day is to start the day strong. Your breakfast (or whatever meal you break your fast with) should have a high amount of healthy fats, proteins, and carbohydrates in the form of dark leafy greens, or dark berries.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This simple format to put together your first meal of the day means that you are likely getting a good amount of the vital nutrients that you require to feel energized, nourished, and satiated.</span><b>Most important of all!</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Enjoy yourself. This time of year is meant to remind us of the good in our fellow man and woman. Gift giving, social events, and even family baking are all ways we reconnect with friends, family, and coworkers to remember the year that has passed, and the one that is ahead. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/6.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8530"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/6.jpg"" alt="""" width=""674"" height=""358"" /></a>",,8525,2018-12-23 14:10:33,2018-12-23 19:10:33,closed,open,christmas-cravings-and-how-to-stay-in-control,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,8526,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595233491,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Christmas Cravings (And How to Stay in Control) | Effective Weight Loss Now,,https://effective-weight-lossnow.info/christmas-cravings-and-how-to-stay-in-control/,192.185.2.78,2018-12-27 13:21:41,2018-12-27 18:21:41,[&#8230;] Christmas Cravings (And How to Stay in Control) [&#8230;],0,pingback,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58,Why Are New Year’s Resolutions Important?,https://freeformfitness.ca/why-are-new-years-resolutions-important/,"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 19:07:01 +0000",admin,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8538,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It’s that time of year again. January 1. This time of a brand new year is the perfect time to reflect on the year that has passed, and set new goals for the present. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Setting goals this time of year may seem too “mainstream” or ridiculous because society expects new year’s resolutions to fail, but this is really a shame. Goal setting is incredibly powerful, and should never be seen as a wasted activity. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Personal growth and accomplishment is something we all want, and arguably, </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">need</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in our lives. If we never take the time to evaluate our current situation and make plans to improve, we will be depriving ourselves of a human need.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These are the 4 reasons we </span><b>strongly</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> suggest you set new year’s resolutions this year.</span><b>Taking Time to Reflect is Something We All Need</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In order to set proper goals for the new year, it is important to reflect on the year that has passed and decide what we loved and what we didn’t love. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Reflecting on the people, the choices, and the events that made us happy will help us to set goals for the new year that will ensure further happiness in our lives. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-4.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8539"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""324"" height=""496"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We all can get caught up in the hamster wheel of life that we never actually take a moment to think about things. We simply catch ourselves feeling happy, or sad, or angry, or tired - for a fleeting moment and then keep on going with our busy lives.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Take the new year as a time to really think about the year that passed and how the year ahead can give you more time for health, happiness, friendships, love, excitement, and fulfillment.</span><b>Goal Setting is Powerful</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">We have written about goal setting and motivation a few times on the Free Form blog (</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/hack-motivation-to-set-better-goals/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">1</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/4-ways-maintain-motivation/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">2</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">) and how it can be incredibly effective for changing your life. All major leaders and successful individuals practice regular goal setting to keep them on track and to help them further progress their success.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you want to find success in your health and wellness goals, think about what </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">exactly</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> you want to achieve. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If it is weight loss - how much?</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> If it is more energy - what for? </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If it is better nutrition - what does better nutrition mean to you?</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2-4.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8540"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2-4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""950"" height=""635"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The more specific your goal, the more likely you are to achieve the goal.</span><b>Take Advantage of the “New Year, New Me” Motivational High</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The fact of the matter is that this time of year the majority of people are out there feeling extra motivated to change their lives. Use that boost in motivation to get creative with your goals.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8541"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""566"" height=""535"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Part of successful goal setting is telling people who respect about what your goals are in order to secure accountability. When you are at your New Year’s celebrations, ask everyone what they are thinking for their resolutions and share yours. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By putting it out into the universe and sharing with the ones you care about, you are further cementing the goal in your mind.</span><b>Growth and Personal Challenges Will Make You More Happy this Year.</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If more happiness is something you hope to achieve than the simple act of working towards a goal will achieve that. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8542"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""615"" height=""396"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Challenging ourselves and experiencing the little wins along the way are a surefire way to increase overall happiness. If you set yourself the kinds of goals that allow you to celebrate many little-wins along the way, then you are potentially looking at a whole year of continued happiness and success. </span><b>This is a Trend you </b><b><i>should</i></b><b> buy into</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although it may seem cheesy or silly to even bother with New Year’s resolutions, this is something that we should all be open and supportive of. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Goal setting should be happening throughout the whole year, but taking this time, when the global consciousness is focused on change and renewal, to set 1 or a few long-term goals is worth it. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lastly, if you hear someone talking about their New Year’s resolutions and hear others shutting them down in that moment of vulnerability, stick up for them. A large part of why people miss out on this opportunity to set goals is because they are afraid of what other people will say. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This year be the person who cheers them on. Goals are more likely to be achieved when there are more people supporting the goal. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From the whole Free Form Fitness team, we hope you have a safe and happy New Year! We can’t wait to see what the Free Form Family will be able to achieve in 2019!</span>",,8538,2018-12-31 14:07:01,2018-12-31 19:07:01,closed,open,why-are-new-years-resolutions-important,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,8539,xyz_fbap,1,_custom_body_class,,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,1,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595015014,1,shared_counts_total,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Why Are New Year’s Resolutions Important? | Effective Weight Loss Now,,https://effective-weight-lossnow.info/why-are-new-years-resolutions-important/,192.185.2.78,2019-01-02 12:51:47,2019-01-02 17:51:47,[&#8230;] Why Are New Year’s Resolutions Important?

59,5 Tips to Master Meal Prep,https://freeformfitness.ca/5-tips-to-master-meal-prep/,"Sun, 06 Jan 2019 23:03:01 +0000",admin,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8555,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are many tools out there to stay on track with your healthy eating habits. Looking up recipes, following specific meal plans, food tracking, and meal prepping are just a few examples of these. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Of all of the above-mentioned, meal prepping is a great way to make sure you are ready for the week and all of your meals will be in line with your health goals. It helps to safeguard you from those long days at work when you might snack out of boredom. It also frees up your evenings so you have more time for the things that matter. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are many ways to approach meal prepping so that it best suits your needs and your lifestyle. Here are our 5 tips to master meal prepping!</span><b>Pick Your Meal Prep day(s)</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Benjamin Franklin said “ failing to plan is planning to fail” and this is very true when it comes to meal prepping. If you don’t plan a day, or days, to meal prep, then it won’t be nearly as effective.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1.1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8556"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1.1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""956"" height=""476"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The fact is, meal prep takes time. So you need to pick a day or two where you can set aside the time to prepare all of the food you will be enjoying that week.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most people typically pick a day on the weekend for this, but if that doesn’t fit your schedule, then pick a different day! The whole point of meal prepping is to make </span><b><i>your</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> day-to-day easier. </span><b>Don’t be afraid to prep more than once a week</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Menu fatigue is a real thing for some people and that can make prepping the same meal for the whole week sound like a horrible idea. If you know that you will get bored of your meals after a few days, then pick a second day of the week to prep a new batch of meals.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having more than 1 day in the week also means that each meal prep time is cut down slightly. So if you only have an hour of 2 of free time, splitting up your meal prep days can be an effective way to work it into your schedule.</span><b>The Meals don’t have to be 100% put together</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Most people understand meal prep as fully preparing the meals so that all you have to do is stick it in the microwave at work, or add the salad dressing. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8557"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""734"" height=""548"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But there is another way to meal prep that is somewhat inspired by the restaurant industry. If you like to cook your meals fresh, and you have a little more time at home in the evenings, then preparing large batches of individual ingredients may be a better option for you.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Everyone knows someone who prepares a large quantity of pasta sauce and then freezes it for later. You can apply this to all kinds of meals. Simply prepare the individual parts of the recipe, and then tuck them in a container to be used later. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This also allows for more creativity and options with your meals throughout the week as you can mix and match different ingredients on different days to have many different meals.</span><b>Get the Right Containers</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8558 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""362"" height=""533"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Having the right containers for your meal prep is essential. If you know you are going to be prepping a lot of soups, you don’t want a square container with a loose seal because your lunchbag will be covered in the soup before you get to work. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Glass containers are the ideal choice for meals that are going to be reheated or will have an oily dressing or sauce on them. Microwaving plastic containers can release harmful chemicals into your food, so using glass will make sure you are only consuming the food you prepared. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oily dressings and sauces will also soak into plastic containers. From an efficiency standpoint this is a nightmare because when you go home to clean your containers, you’ll be at the sink for a long time trying to scrub out the oily residue. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The whole point of meal prepping is to save you time, so just invest in the good glass containers.</span><b>Invest in Meal Prepping Power Tools</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you were doing a home reno, you could get the job done with a simple screwdriver, but it might take you forever. Completing the same project with a power tool like a drill would get the same job done much faster.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are power tools for meal prepping as well. The crock pot and the pressure cooker are incredibly helpful tools when you are trying to prep a lot of food. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Crock pots, or slow cookers, are a one of the simplest ways to prepare delicious food. For most slow cooker recipes you just put all of the ingredients in the pot and then let it cook for 6-10 hours. When it is done, you have a very tasty meal that is full of flavour.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you haven’t yet, try preparing meat on the bone in a crockpot. It will come out juicy, full of whatever flavour you cooked it in, and it will literally fall right off the bone.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The pressure cooker is the opposite of the slow cooker. It uses the pressure from steam in a contained vessel to cook your food at incredible speeds. Although the food is not sitting and soaking up flavour as it does in the slow cooker, meals prepared in this power tool are still just as juicy and flavourful.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8559 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4.jpg"" alt="""" width=""453"" height=""448"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Each power tool has its benefits for different lifestyles. If you just want to throw the ingredients in a pot, let it sit and get other errands done, then the slow cooker is a great tool for you. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you are more likely to be setting aside time in your day to prep, but don’t want to wait a long time for your food to cook, then the pressure cooker is the better option for you. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Meal prep takes a little bit of time, effort, and thought to achieve but with these 5 tips, we truly believe that anyone can become a master meal prepper!</span>

60,Should You Share Your Goals or Not?,https://freeformfitness.ca/should-you-share-your-goals-or-not/,"Sun, 13 Jan 2019 19:19:55 +0000",admin,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=8567,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the season of goal setting and motivation it is important to understand all aspects of goal setting. What will help you reach them faster? Are they realistic? Who can help you achieve them?</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With social media it is so easy to announce our goals and intentions to the world in a matter of moments. Does sharing our goals with the world help or hinder our progress? Are there other strategies to help you achieve your goals this year (and make them last a lifetime??).</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This week we cover whether sharing our goals is the best idea or not, and how you can best bolster your New Year’s Resolutions so there’s so much more to celebrate throughout the year.</span><b>To Share or No to Share?</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8568"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""754"" height=""428"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">How many of you made a public post to a social media platform about your New Year’s Resolutions? It feels good to put it out into the universe and feel as though by sharing it, it will manifest itself. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Research is actually torn as to whether or not this is a good idea.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For years social psychologists have argued that by speaking your goals out loud, you brain believes that by you saying the goal, you have achieved it. This essentially turns off the mechanisms in your brain that will motivate you to work towards that goal because it already thinks the goal is complete. </span><a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself?language=en&amp;referrer=playlist-goals&amp;utm_campaign=tedspread&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=tedcomshare""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This TED Talk</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> sums it up nicely.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8569"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""718"" height=""408"" /></a><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Derek Sivers, TED Talk Oxford, “Keep Your Goals to Yourself”</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">On the flip side of the argument is a study published in the </span><a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13142-012-0183-y""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Journal of Translational Behaviour Medicine</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Compared to the research that argues against sharing your goals (most of which was published from 1920 to 2009), this study takes into account sharing your goals </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> your progress on social media.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-1.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8570 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""290"" height=""500"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What this study found was that participants who shared their goal and their progress on twitter lost more weight that those who did not. This was in part because as participants shared their progress, there was further engagement from their peers that either gave more information and guidance that would help with achieving their goals, or simply offered support and reassurance.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This idea of sharing our goals and intentions online has been taken to the app world with apps like Weilos (recently acquired by Weight Watchers), which is a social media platform specifically for sharing progress pictures, and </span><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/complete-to-do-list-and-tasks/id1201833673?mt=8""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Complete</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, which is an app where you can publicize your to-do list to the app so that other members can help hold you accountable to those items.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These apps and newer research studies suggest the opposite of the previous studies mentioned, stating that by getting cheers of support from friends and the community, you crave more praise and reward from them. Instead of the praise and reward shutting off the motivation to work harder in your brain, it may actually keep the fire burning bright.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8571"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""446"" height=""236"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When research cannot agree sometimes it is best to change the question. Instead of “Should we share?” maybe we change the question to “What do we share?”</span><b>What shall we share?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In articles that review the older studies that tout the importance of keeping your goals secret, they do offer other ways to share without stating the goal and thus turning off the motivation entirely.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Instead of simple saying your goal is to “lose 15lbs” or “Stop smoking”, setting intention statements is better. These are the classic </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">if-then</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> statements. Instead of your brain hearing the final goal, it hears a blueprint and a plan to achieve a goal. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8572"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""594"" height=""478"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It looks something like this:</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If I am going to lose 15lbs, then I have to eat more greens, move at least 30 minutes every day, and get 7+ hours of sleep.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Or,</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If I will quit smoking in 2019, then I will need to cut down the number of cigarettes I smoke by half every week.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sharing progress regularly is also a great way to achieve your goals, because the micro-doses of support from your community will slowly become something you look forward to and crave. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Remembering the kind words of encouragement from the last progress post you made, will ring loudly until you make your next progress post.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the end sharing your goals is entirely up to you. Sometimes goals are incredibly personal and sharing them would leave you feeling too exposed to even attempt to achieve them. With this article we hope that we have given you a few more insights into how the brain processes and manages goals and motivation so that you are better equipped to see success this year!</span>

Apparently, according to an academic from Cardiff University in the UK, blue Monday is the most depressing day of the year based on its distance from the holidays, the weather, and a number of other factors. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now before this starts to sound too depressing, he actually came up with this date in order to inspire people to take action, and reignite their motivation and passions from the beginning of the year. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Riding on the hopes and dreams of this, we bring you 4 ways to boost your mood!</span><b>Embrace the day and go outside!</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Humans evolved outdoors so limiting our time spent there is easily understood as a disservice to our wellbeing. In the scientific communities, this need to be near nature is known as </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2760412/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">biophilia</span></i></a><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It the biological need to be outside and amongst the trees and the bees. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Us northerners unfortunately kiss the majority of our greenery goodbye in the winter months, but that doesn’t mean that we are doomed for depression this time of year. </span><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494415000328""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Studies</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> have shown that even just looking at images of nature can have a physiological effect on us, lowering blood pressure, putting the mind at ease, and even improving focus.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8580"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/1-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""766"" height=""511"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With your office or bedroom now decorated with images of lush forests and waterfalls, it is now time to </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">actually</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> spend some time outside. This is because vitamin D can only be naturally produced by exposing our skin to sunshine. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vitamin D deficiency, due to its involvement in the production of mood regulation chemicals in our brain, has </span><a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/reading-between-the-headlines/201307/vitamin-d-deficiency-and-depression""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">been shown</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to lead to feelings of sadness and depression. Although ample sunlight throughout the summer months can build up a reserve of vitamin D, by this point, our reserves are running low. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8581"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""769"" height=""511"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So you either take a vitamin D supplement, or opt for the free solution and get outside for some skiing, skating, snowshoeing, biking, snowboarding, etc. We are Canadians and facing the winters is what we makes us so strong!</span><b>Eat some soul serving foods</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What we put into our bodies has a profound effect on our mental and physical health. There are some foods that make us feel full of energy, clear headed, and beautiful from the inside out. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Then there are foods that give us a moment of satisfaction, followed by inflammation, digestion issues, skin issues, feelings of guilt, loss of energy, and even feelings of depression. These are the highly processed and highly sweetened foods that have been designed to leave us wanting more.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8582"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""759"" height=""502"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you want to feel satisfied in every way possible by your food follow these simple guidelines:</span><ul><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whole foods first. Not the grocery store - the actual products that could be found in an animal or grown from mother nature herself. Treat your body like the temple it is and feed it the grass fed, free range, organic options so that you get the most from the bounties that nature provides.</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If it has been processed in a factory, then your body will have to work like a machine to break it down. The more effort your body requires to break down a food and all of its foreign ingredients, the more inflammation and stress your body produces. Stress and inflammation affect everything in our bodies and interfere with its ability to function optimally.</span></li><li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Drink water (and lots of it!). Water is such a simple nutrient that we often forget all about. Coffees and sodas, although quench thirst and come with fun things like caffeine and sugar, do not give the body enough of its most basic nutrient. Get 1L for every 50lbs of bodyweight, or drink water until your urine is a clear colour.</span></li></ul><b>Revisit your goals</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Remember those New Year’s Resolutions you set a few weeks ago? How are they doing? Have you celebrated any small wins related to your goals in the last few weeks? Maybe you didn’t set any goals, but have a few life plans you are pursuing. How’s that going?</span><a href=""https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/new-years-resolutions-1-month-later#1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By now 36%</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of people who set goals at the beginning of the year have already given up. This is not meant to discourage. No - in fact this should be motivating for 2 reasons. It means that 64% of you are still going strong! The second reason is that the year just started, so there is still so much time left to restart or reset your goals!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now how does this relate to your overall mood? </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4551495/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">According to research</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, the active pursuit of goals has been shown to correlate with better quality of life. Humans need to feel accomplished and need to feel a sense of purpose. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">By setting goals and achieving them, we feed into those needs and as a result enjoy better self-esteem, and better overall wellbeing. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8583"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""761"" height=""512"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So revisit your goals or life plans that you set, find a little-win to celebrate, and keep taking action every day to achieve your goals!</span><b>Last but certainly not least - Sweat!</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Did you really think we could write an entire article on how to boost your mood and not include exercising?</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exercising is by far the easiest way to improve your mood. By changing your physical state, you are able to change your mental and emotional state. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/6.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8584"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/6.jpg"" alt="""" width=""759"" height=""531"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exercising can provide a sense of community and connection if you workout with friends or a personal trainer. Working out also increases blood flow throughout the body, improves how we perceive ourselves, increases production of happy hormones and mood boosting brain chemicals, and is a sure fire way to make you feel </span><b><i>amazing</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So get outside, exercise, bring a few healthy snacks, and take action on your goals.

I was born in the UK and came to Ottawa in March 2000 as part of my job with Nortel Networks, back in the days of the optical telecoms boom. I liked Ottawa and Canada and decided to stay. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8609"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""642"" height=""582"" /></a><b>RP: When did you first decide to join Free Form Fitness?</b><b>TG: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">End of September 2016. When I was younger I had done a fair bit of strength work from time to time and knew that my body responded well to it, but I had neglected functional strength over the years and just done cardio, I was injury-prone and pretty squishy as well. I had completed up to a half-iron distance triathlons and several half marathons but I didn’t feel healthy in my mid 40s. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8610"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/3-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""662"" height=""246"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Entering the 2nd half of my forties I became more aware of the benefits of strength training on physical and brain health as we age. BUT, I had a long history of ‘non-compliance’ attending group classes, using a gym or following a program. I needed to find the right place, that understood how to motivate and interest me and make suitable goals. One of the signs in the Kanata location that really resonates with me and my reasons to join is one that says simply “Age Healthy”. That’s what’s most important to me. And if I can have fun and feel accomplished doing it then I’m happy.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8611"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/4-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""367"" height=""500"" /></a><b>RP: What was your initial goal when you joined?</b><b>TG: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Merely to improve my functional fitness, stick to a program, have fun and not waste my money (which is what I usually did by dropping out). Although I knew I would get strong reasonably easily once we overcame the initial challenges I was adamant that I wanted a gradual start so that I learned good technique and didn’t overdo things early on. If the day-2 muscle soreness was too bad I knew that I would get frustrated and disheartened. I was also pretty demanding and particular about what types of exercises made me feel good. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">My biggest priority was enjoying my sessions so that I wanted to come back. That meant exercises that challenged my brain as well as body, things that tested my stabilizers so I had to concentrate on not falling over instead of just reps - so a plank on a Swiss ball, rather than a plank on the floor for example. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8612"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/5-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""689"" height=""391"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Also, because I was (still am) pretty large around the torso, exercises that were impinged by body bulk just made me feel clumsy and out of shape. I’m focusing on getting strong rather than cutting weight, and as I get strong I find that my body composition is evolving - more muscle, less fat - so clothes fit better, but the scale is not a friend.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/6-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8613"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/6-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""525"" height=""691"" /></a><b>RP: Has your goal changed since you started?</b><b>TG: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hell yes! I really enjoyed lifting heavy and how it made me feel. Once we worked that out I started to learn to use barbells and started powerlifting. Now working on building my technique and strength at the three main lifts, with a view to competing occasionally. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/7.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8614"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/7.jpg"" alt="""" width=""539"" height=""704"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I want to push the limits of what I can lift and am aiming for a 400lb deadlift. I started out as Novice or Beginner for all my lifts on Strengthlevel.com, now on two I am intermediate, and aiming for advanced. A dream of mine it to get a CPF Masters lifting record in my category. There is so much to learn, I had no idea how much technique went in to doing a good bench press for example. This is keeping it fresh and interesting for me.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/8.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8615"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/8.jpg"" alt="""" width=""566"" height=""558"" /></a><b>RP: What type of adversity have you faced in the time you’ve been with Free Form?</b><b>TG: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Business travel &amp; trips home to visit family - getting good at using hotel gyms (but sometimes they have limited lifting options so I have to adapt) and have a great lifting gym in my parents’ village where they are super welcoming; so we plan my training cycles around travel, knowing that equipment and time might be limited. I do remember teaching an Air Canada flight attendant some body weight squats on one long haul flight to Hong Kong!</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hong-kong.jpg""></a><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/9.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8616 aligncenter"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/9.jpg"" alt="""" width=""356"" height=""536"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fitting gym in during summer riding season - leading a group cycle ride, straight after leg day is a special level of pain. I tend to drop my weight training back to more of a maintenance level so that I can enjoy the good weather and cycling friends. Because I cycle, my legs can get pretty sore from that, and I have to also work on hip mobility because I am a cubicle dweller at work too.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/10.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8618"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/10.jpg"" alt="""" width=""727"" height=""487"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In Feb 2018 I had a mountain bike crash where I went over the handlebars (note to any cyclists who travel, the brakes are reversed in the UK!). I got quite a limiting soft-tissue arm injury, so we made adaptations for the couple of months that it took to heal. Now stronger than ever but was a little fed up at the time.</span><b>RP: Have you experienced success at Free Form Fitness? Tell us how you got there.</b><b>TG: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oh my goodness, where to start!? At first I hated squats with a passion, I would cuss and mutter at my poor trainer when they suggested them, I literally learned squat technique by squatting down to a chair, I did single leg RDLs with a broomstick for support and had to do so many foundational things before even touching a barbell or squat rack. One particularly memorable day I worked up to reps of goblet squats with a 100lb dumbbell and it was pretty much time to get serious with barbells. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Another milestone was 7 plates each side for a leg press max.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/11.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8619"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/11.jpg"" alt="""" width=""630"" height=""476"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now I love to encourage newer gym members with my story, since it can be pretty intimidating to get started. It’s really hard to describe the mental and physical high that comes from lifting heavy weights. I wish more women knew about how awesome it is. Lift heavy $hit, feel badass. Plus you can open jam jars and carry all your grocery bags from the car in one go. In August I attempted my first powerlifting meet, I was super nervous but the community were so supportive and encouraging. I didn’t do as well as I hoped, but learned so much. It’s given me new empathy for my role helping new cyclists too.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/12.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8620"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/12.jpg"" alt="""" width=""702"" height=""220"" /></a><b>RP: How else do you live a healthy lifestyle?</b><b>TG: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Diet, exercise (bike, walk, massage / FST maintenance, and mental health) - time with friends, secret FB support group; being kind when rest needed etc </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I tend to eat a reduced carb diet, my brain and energy levels work better with it. I cannot eat gluten and have some silly reactions to things like raw fruit and veggies, so I do watch what I eat. I love good food and cooking though, so if I am going to have something rich I would rather have less of something really good. Budget permitting, life is too short to eat processed cheese and low quality chocolate. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I am a huge fan of gin, Negroni cocktails and Pimm’s. But tend to drink only once a week most of the time. I’ll have days when I run out of oomph completely and recharge on the couch, those days are needed so I don’t begrudge them. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/13.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8621"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/13.jpg"" alt="""" width=""513"" height=""678"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m learning how important FST, massage and mobility work are for keeping me lifting heavy. So I put effort in to those before and after my workouts. I’m single and my family is in England, so my friends are really important to me - both for company and mental health. Ideally I combine socialising with a workout or hike, but sometimes chilling over coffee and a natter (British Slang for ‘Chat’) is just what is needed. I made a secret Facebook group for some close friends where we support each other (rant, vent, post for accountability or whatever). Oftentimes, we think we are alone in our challenges, but others often feel the same way. I find sharing really helps me and others.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/14.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8622"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/14.jpg"" alt="""" width=""776"" height=""258"" /></a><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/15.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8623"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/15.jpg"" alt="""" width=""909"" height=""390"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Know yourself and any reasons for previous fails etc; talk to other clients - it really helps for support (them and you!) and to see other friendly faces. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Don’t be self-conscious - everyone is too busy doing their own thing to worry about you.

It’s good for your brain!</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">”? Ever wonder why? </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With a complex organ ruling our every move and emotion, researchers have done a ton of work looking into the specific nutrients that could improve the overall health of the brain. There is one nutrient in particular that is especially powerful when it comes to optimal brain health. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Read on to find out which nutrient has the power to promote brain cell growth, and decrease your risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8637"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""490"" height=""267"" /></a></span><b>OMEGA-3’S (Specifically DHA)</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the standard north american diet, it has been observed that our omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is at about 20:1, when it should be 1:1. Although it is good to have omega-6’s in our diet, these fatty acids have been known to be inflammatory when consumed in high quantities. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Omega-3’s are commonly broken down into DHA, DPA, and EPA. These 3 omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Omega-3 PUFA’s) are the focus of many brain health, metabolism, and anti-cancer studies. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In your brain these 3 are critical to the function and health of the brain. In a study published in the journal </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404917/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, which reviewed a number of studies on the effects of Omega-3 PUFA’s on the brain, it was discovered that as DHA levels decrease in the brain, it begins to alter the structure of the brain cells, it decreases our ability to perform simple tasks and to call on spatial memory. Furthermore, decreases in DHA were found to alter our brain’s ability to send messages to the rest of the body. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8638"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""719"" height=""488"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not convinced this nutrient is crucial to your brain health?</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In another study published in the </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22938939/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Journal of Clinical Psychiatry</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, researchers found that in patients with dementia, it was consistently found that they had low levels of Omega-3’s in the body. </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18573585/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Research is now suggesting</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that supplementing Omega-3’s could help keep Alzheimer’s at bay as well.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Omega-3’s are truly powerhouse fatty acids in our bodies.</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17030655/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> In a study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> where elderly participants were given DHA supplements, it was seen that their geriatric depressive symptoms decreased, their overall cognitive function increased, and their memory improved.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The benefits of this are not reserved for our later years either.

Fatty fish, algae (vegan source), fortified foods like milk and eggs can all provide you with omega 3’s. This is usually in the form of ALA, which the body can then use to make DHA and EPA. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you want to consume high amounts of DHA and EPA, these can be found in foods like Anchovies (1.54g/75g), Caviar (1.96g/75g), Salted, uncooked mackerel (3.43g/75g), Atlantic Salmon, raw or cooked, (1.61 -1.77g/75g), and </span><a href=""https://www.dermatocare.com/blog/5-reasons-to-eat-ghee-or-clarified-butter-daily""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Ghee</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, clarified butter (1447mg/100g).</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8639"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""712"" height=""531"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can find more sources of ALA, DHA and EPA in </span><a href=""https://www.dietitians.ca/getattachment/de95e92c-3fb3-40db-b457-173de89bdc3a/FACTSHEET-Food-Sources-of-Omega-3-Fats.pdf.aspx""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">this document</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> from the Dietitians of Canada.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Omega-3’s are also available in supplement form. There a few ways supplement companies can source their omega-3’s. Krill oil, fish oil, or for those allergic to fish or looking for a vegan option, algae.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When choosing your omega-3 supplement you need to take into account the potency, the source of the supplement, your budget, and your preferred method of consumption (oil or capsule).</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oils are usually a higher potency, but you have to go endure a sometimes very strong fishy aftertaste, although krill and vegan supplements do not have this issue. Krill oil is usually your best option for potency and the source because the larger fish used for fish oil supplements have a higher chance of contact with heavy metals and other ocean pollutants. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Check out this list from </span><a href=""https://smarter-reviews.com/lp/sr-omega3-krill?tr=lKe90&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA1sriBRD-ARIsABYdwwFnlRoFpoZgq1xeoMqRXsVGQrIox4H4d5QilEf8qGO2cw2JZR1Hr0waAgt8EALw_wcB""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Smarter Reviews</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to see a complete list of the top Omega-3 supplements.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The dietitians of canada suggest that if you want to get the recommended amount of essential fatty acids, to consume at least 2 servings of fatty fish a week.

What you do behind closed doors is up to you but there is one thing that shouldn’t be so hush-hush.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Libido, or your innate desire for intimacy, is a part of being a living creature on earth. It is what drives the most basic need to pro-create and populate the earth. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But did you know that you can actually control the strength of your libido? Yes - you can both weaken your libido and boost it.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1.gif""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8649"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1.gif"" alt="""" width=""480"" height=""202"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For this special Valentine’s day blog, here are a few ways you could be lowering your love drug, and how you can increase its potency!</span><b>First, let’s better understand libido (a.k.a. Our sex drive)</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Science says that libido is controlled by both hormonal and neurological factors. The hormones originating in the gonadal region are the usual reproductive hormones - estrogen and testosterone (primarily). Healthy levels of these will usually mean that you have a healthy sex drive.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2.gif""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8650"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2.gif"" alt="""" width=""245"" height=""140"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As we age and these hormone levels begin to decrease, libido is left to the mind to keep at a high level. The arousal center in the old brain, our amygdala, can maintain a high sex drive even when our reproductive hormones hit their lowest points.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8651"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/3-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""599"" height=""416"" /></a><b>Feeling a little low? </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although modern medicine and food science are great developments, apparently putting foreign chemicals into our bodies can mess with our most basic needs.

Prescriptions like the birth control pill, antidepressants like Prozac and Zoloft, antihistamines (allergy medicine), and painkillers like Vicodin and Percocet have all been shown to lower levels of your sex hormones, or block neurotransmitters in the brain associated with the amygdala.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For some of us, things like the birth control pill or antihistamines are essential for other areas of your health, but have no fear! There are a number of ways to naturally boost your libido.</span><b>Aphrodisiacs to the Rescue!</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You may have heard of the term </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">aphrodisiacs</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> before. Derived from the greek goddess of love’s name, Aphrodite, an aphrodisiac is believed to be a natural libido booster. It either acts on the physical, hormonal, or neurological aspect of libido.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most well-known aphrodisiacs is </span><b>chocolate</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Quality chocolate, that isn’t made with large amounts of sugar or milk, has been shown to increase sex drive by boosting the neurotransmitters associated with the arousal centers in the brain.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/4.gif""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8652"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/4.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""375"" /></a><b>Some fruits </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">have also been observed to be libido boosters like bananas, avocados, and figs. Although research has yet to prove the true power of these fruits up to this point. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Planning on having a </span><b>glass of wine</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> at dinner? Try sticking to just one glass. Too much alcohol is a depressant on the entire body. Although it may lower inhibitions making you feel more confident in the bedroom, your ability to perform could be affected.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/5.gif""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8653"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/5.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""282"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There are also many </span><b>herbs</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that people having been using for years to help with their sex drive. Gingko biloba has been observed to boost libido, as well as garlic! So turn things up with a little garlic, but just make sure to bring some gum so the garlic breath doesn’t become a turn off.</span><b>Meditation and stress relieving activities</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are also great aphrodisiacs. Stress in the body shuts everything down so that the body can fight or flee from the stress. This includes your reproductive hormones. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Try meditating or practicing other forms of stress management to ensure your body is ready to go when things start to heat up!</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Last, but certainly not least, </span><b>exercise</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. Exercise is once again one of the best things you can do to have your body working exactly how it was intended to.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/6.gif""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8654"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/6.gif"" alt="""" width=""304"" height=""201"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Not only does exercise help maintain healthy levels of testosterone in the body, exercising also gives us confidence. That confidence shuts off the self-doubt and allows the arousal centers in our brain to work unhindered.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Better libido is just a workout, garlic-y avocado with a glass of wine away! </span><b>Happy Valentine’s Day</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">! </span>",,8648,2019-02-10 21:16:00,2019-02-11 02:16:00,closed,open,libido-and-exercise,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,8649,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,1,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595032481,1,shared_counts_total,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

</b><b>Personal Trainer - Byward Market</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For a long time we were told that cholesterol was bad for our heart health. It is what partially villainized eggs amongst the cardiac health community for many years. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With more research being done on this vital nutrient, we are now seeing a distinction between good and bad cholesterol. In fact, we have known for a long time that cholesterol is important to our health as it provides the rigidity to our cells that is essential for the health of our cells. But when it comes to good vs. bad cholesterol, what really is the difference?</span><b>HDL vs. LDL</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-1.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8661 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""275"" height=""368"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When I was learning about good and bad cholesterol the best way to think about it was HDL was “Happy” cholesterol. HDL starts with H and so does happy. Then I just knew that LDL was the bad type.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">HDL stands for </span><b>high density lipoprotein</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and LDL stands for</span><b> low-density lipoprotein</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. The high density lipoproteins are actually made in the liver and act as a clean up crew in the blood vessels. When they are produced, they circulate the blood vessels looking for plaque and LDL to be transported back to the liver where they will be broken down and eliminated. </span><b>DIetary Cholesterol vs. Blood Cholesterol</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Dietary cholesterol is obviously the cholesterol that you consume through your diet. You can get dietary cholesterol from animal sources like meat and organs, as well as animal byproducts like eggs and dairy foods, as well as shellfish.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your body will produce more cholesterol naturally when you consume saturated and trans fats. These types of fats cause an increase in LDL, the bad cholesterol. It was recommended that we consume fewer fats because when there is a lot of LDL cholesterol circulating in the blood, it picks up other substances and sticks to the walls of the blood vessels creating partial, and sometimes complete, blockages.</span><b>What fats are good for cholesterol?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Polyunsaturated fats have actually</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7625348""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> been shown</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> to decrease LDL cholesterol levels in the blood and lower blood triglyceride levels (free fat molecules in the blood). Some food sources of these fats include flax seeds, chia seeds, brazil nuts, walnuts, whole almonds, olive oil, butter, eggs, avocado, and firm tofu.</span><b>Other ways to boost good cholesterol</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Decreasing your carbohydrate intake can improve your HDL concentration. </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26224300""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In a study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that split diabetic patients into 2 groups, one high carb-low fat diet group, and one low carb diet, both groups lost weight but the HDL increased in the low carb diet and the HDL </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">decreased</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in the high carb diet. Meaning the more carbs we eat, the fewer defences we have against bad cholesterol accumulation in our blood vessels.</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25833778""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Purple produce</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> has also been shown to increase HDL levels in the body - by up to 19%! That can make a huge difference in the life of someone who is at risk of cardiovascular disease. This is due to an antioxidant in purple produce that when supplemented in studies shows increases from 13% - 19% in blood HDL levels. Purple produce includes red cabbage, purple corn, eggplant, blueberries, and blackberries.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8662"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""374"" height=""253"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A somewhat controversial addition to your diet might be coconut oil. This is because coconut oil is high in saturated fats. Although this is true, studies have still shown that coconut oil actually increases HDL concentrations in the blood. </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19437058""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This study</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> compared coconut oil to soybean oil and actually showed a decrease in HDL in the group that consumed the soybean oil.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">And, of course, exercise! All forms of exercise, low intensity, high intensity, weight training, and cardio have shown increases in HDL in individuals. The greatest increase in HDL was seen in high-intensity exercisers. If high-intensity isn’t your style, then that’s okay. All forms of exercise have shown improvements.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Focusing on the strategies and lifestyle choices that will increase your HDL will set you on a path to longevity and good heart health. Remember that HDL is the clean-up crew that gets rid of the bad cholesterol that only acts to clog up your arteries. </span>",,8660,2019-02-18 08:55:02,2019-02-18 13:55:02,closed,open,good-vs-bad-cholesterol-is-there-really-a-difference,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,8661,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595224651,1,shared_counts_total,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(The drugs helped too – thank you, Dr. Chih).  First, the Heart Institute’s Rehabilitation Program got me walking slowly on a treadmill for 20 minutes.  Then, last July, Catherine and Vania took over. With two ½ hour sessions a week, they got me doing movements and assuming yoga-like poses that I thought I would never be able to do again.  Some exercises required the use of FFF’s equipment, but many were simple movements that, now I know how to do them correctly, I do at home on the days between my training sessions. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is wonderful to again walk normally and upright, to climb stairs without pain, to be more stable on my feet, and to be able to squat when I need to access a low cupboard.

</b><b>Personal Trainer - Byward Market</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If the rise of the ketogenic diet’s popularity has done anything (don’t worry this isn’t another keto diet blog), it has restarted the conversation about fats. More specifically good fats vs. bad fats. We have touched on some of this in our various blog posts about</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/is-fat-making-us-fat/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> fats </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">and </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/good-vs-bad-cholesterol-is-there-really-a-difference/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">cholesterol.</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> This week we want to go a little deeper into the topic. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Through the industrialisation of food, food manufacturer’s have come up with ways to cut costs and create cheaper products to help boost their profit margins. In doing this, they have created ingredients that should not otherwise exist. Damaged fats are a scary example of this. Scary because of the effect they have on our body - down to a cellular level!</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8688"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""580"" height=""383"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So what is a damaged fat and why should you avoid them? Read more to find out!</span><b>What is a “damaged fat”?</b><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health/ways-to-avoid-hydrogenated-oil""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Damaged fats</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are fats that have been altered by a manufacturing process. Typically by condensing the fats and adding heat to </span><a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hydrogenate""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">hydrogenate</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> them. These become trans-fats. </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Trans</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is a term in chemistry that describes the orientation of chemical bonds around a double bond.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8689"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""426"" height=""208"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you think of typical oils that are used in cooking or that you would find on food labels you have examples like olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, and grapeseed oil - to name a few. Now if you think of the origin of those oils, which ones are naturally oily? </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Olives are like nature’s fat bomb. You squeeze an olive and you get oil. This is a great example of a natural and healthy oil. Olives do not need to be overly processed in order yield olive oil. Soybeans on the other hand are very different. A soybean is a small, dry, bean. 1 bushel of soybeans, which is about 60lbs of soybeans, only makes around </span><a href=""https://ussec.org/resources/conversion-table/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">10lbs of soybean oil</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. This means that the soybeans need to be seriously modified and manufactured in order to create soybean oil, and even then the yield is 1lb for every 6lbs of soybeans.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Soybean oil is one of the great examples of a cheap crop that is used to death to manufacture food. What the manufacturer’s may not have realized while they were cutting costs was that by altering and damaging the fats, they were creating harmful foods for our bodies. </span><b>Why You Should Avoid Them</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">These trans fats are so harmful to the body that they can worsen memory, weaken arteries, and change the structure of our cells. Trans-fats are actually </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9216565""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">pro-oxidants</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, meaning they cause </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4665476/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">oxidative stress</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in the body. You’ve likely heard of antioxidants? Things like dark berries and green tea are all examples of antioxidants and are great for the body because they protect your body from oxidative stress. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oxidative stress has been linked to illnesses such as cancer, and so the less we have of it the better.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8690"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""497"" height=""748"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Furthermore, trans-fats prevent a necessary component of blood flow from forming. The more trans-fats you eat, the less you produce this component (</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24228623""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">prostacyclin for those wondering</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">), which leads to weaker blood flow and therefore heart disease and arterial complications.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Fats like sunflower, corn, and soybean oil all </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5603143/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">oxidize cholesterol</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> in the body.

Well when you consume these oils, they change the chemical structure of the bad cholesterols, making them the perfect plaque for your arteries, leading to heart disease. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">What’s worse is they are finding connections between heart disease risk factors and brain health risk factors. So if you are consuming a lot of these damaged fats, not only are you putting your heart at risk, but you are also jeopardizing the functionality and health of your brain. If you want to remain sharp and healthy for a long time, it is best to avoid these damaged fats.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/the-nutrient-that-could-change-your-brain/""><b>Related Article: Nutrient that Could Change Your Brain!</b></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here is the full list of oils and foods that contain these harmful fats:</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Soybean oil

Something to think about. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So moving forward, take a second look at the food labels and ingredients lists in your kitchen and consider switching to some of the healthier, less harmful options.</span>

Good carbs vs. bad carbs, healthy vs. unhealthy fats, and good vs. bad cholesterol. There is one more big debate that people are having and that is whether or not salt is really all that bad?</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Some diets say we need more than the recommended amount of salt, and some people are still saying that limiting salt is one of the best ways to keep ourselves in good health and avoid heart disease and obesity.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As we do here on the FFF blog, we are going to dive into the research and hopefully help you decide if salt is the seasoning of the century or something to steer clear of.</span><b>The Salty Link Between Salt and Poor Health</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A number of </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5098396/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">research studies</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, </span><a href=""https://www.health24.com/Lifestyle/Healthy-you/7-reasons-why-too-much-salt-is-bad-for-you-20180215""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">articles</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and </span><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/salt-good-or-bad""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">individuals</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> have found a link between a high salt diet and things like high blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease and increase the risk of stroke. A high salt diet can also lead to the </span><a href=""https://www.medicinenet.com/edema/article.htm""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">swelling</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of hands, ankles, and feet due to salt’s influence on the fluid balance in the body (known as edema). </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Because salt controls the fluid balance in the body, having too much salt in your diet can also stress the kidneys and put you at risk of </span><a href=""http://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/salthealth/factsheets/kidney/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">decreased kidney</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> function.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">High salt diets usually include highly processed foods. Due to all the extra “</span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">junk</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">” in processed foods the risk of developing </span><a href=""https://www.nhs.uk/news/cancer/salty-food-link-to-stomach-cancer/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">stomach and colon cancer</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> increases. The more you eat of these foods, the more your taste buds become accustomed to having them and therefore you crave more. These cravings can be tricky to kick, so by eating too much salty food, you put yourself at risk of only wanting these types of foods, which would just further exacerbate the above-mentioned health conditions.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Salt can be a silent killer but it is also essential to our diet to help control fluid levels in the body, and deliver important electrolytes that are critical to recovery, and muscle and nerve function. </span><b>The Modern Salt Intake</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although salt is important for </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5409062/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">fluid balance and cell function</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, we are currently consuming </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">too much</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of it. Our taste-buds have been trained to crave highly sweet, highly fatty, and highly salty foods. This is why chips are what we crave, instead of a lightly salted piece of meat or a soup. This is why candy is far more enticing than fruits and vegetables. And this is why donuts and cakes, that are high in trans fats, are far more appealing than the healthy fats found in nuts, avocados, and eggs.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8705"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""713"" height=""536"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The recommendation for salt intake is to consume less than 5g/day. Some of you may have heard a different number, potentially somewhere closer to 2g/day? This is because we should only be consuming 2g/day of </span><b>sodium</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, a component of salt, in order to meet all bodily requirements, as stated by </span><a href=""https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/77985/9789241504836_eng.pdf;jsessionid=F6430D57F2BCB7A7F2226170E2BB0F5E?sequence=1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The World Health Organization</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> (WHO). </span><b>So Why Do We Need Salt?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If salt can cause so many health problems, why should we even bother with it?  </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Salt is actually a very broad term to describe a chemical compound. Salt’s, according to chemists, are product of a neutralization reaction between an acid an a base. It takes a negative ion and a positive ion and puts them together to create a neutral compound. All this to say that we have </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">a lot</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of salts out there.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8706"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""539"" height=""408"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The most common one, the one found on our table and therefore named as such, is a combination of Sodium and Chloride. Sodium is actually a very important element in the body. Sodium acts at the bouncer for the cells, controlling how much fluid goes into and out of the cell. Fluid balance is very important in the body. We are, after all, around 70% water. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">I’m sure we’ve all felt the horrible symptoms of dehydration. Light-headed-ness, mental fog, tiredness, and irritability are just a few ways dehydration manifests itself. This is because there isn’t enough fluid in the body, right down to the cellular level, meaning that normal bodily functions cannot occur optimally.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">When our body sends a signal to an organ like the muscles in a workout, a series of reactions occur. One of which is the opening and closing of </span><a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/v/sodium-potassium-pump""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">sodium and potassium gates</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. If there isn’t enough sodium in the body, the flood gates can’t open and flood the cells/extracellular space with sodium. So we get weaker muscle contractions. All signals from the brain to the body are weakened. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8707"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""614"" height=""473"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So salt is important for many reasons, but mostly because of the specific </span><a href=""https://www.google.ca/search?source=hp&amp;ei=4uCDXOz3CaH4jwTNyqvQBw&amp;q=pubmed+electrolytes&amp;btnK=Google+Search&amp;oq=pubmed+electrolytes&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i22i30.31.1874..2187...0.0..0.173.1825.8j8......0....1..gws-wiz.......35i39j0i131i67j0i67j0j0i20i263j0i8i13i30.jXsFC1n81P8""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">electrolytes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> that make up salt and the actions they have on the body.</span><b>What about himalayan pink salt, or sea salt?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The grocery stores now don’t only offer white, table salt but a whole host of salts to choose from. So why are they better, if they are?</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/4-1.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8708 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/4-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""276"" height=""252"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Table salt is simply sodium and chloride with a little bit of junk like micro-plastics to act as fillers (see </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOP_gDVpR2I""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">this video </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">to see the difference between table ands sea salt). The “fancy” salts are better for us because not only do they provide us with the sodium we need without the fillers, but they also have other important electrolytes like magnesium and potassium. So you get more bang for your buck when you decide to salt your food with himalayan pink salt or sea salt.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">They are also far less processed and therefore more natural. Our bodies evolved with nature and therefore we should be consuming foods that are as close to their natural state as possible so as not to cause adverse effects on the body.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8709"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5.jpg"" alt="""" width=""566"" height=""745"" /></a><b>To Salt or Not To Salt?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">From what the research is suggesting, salt may not be the enemy we once thought it was. The enemy is the over-use of salt in the production and manufacturing of foods and the prevalence of those foods in our diet. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you consume a diet that is primarily made up of whole, natural foods, then feel free to salt your food. The electrolytes that you receive are essential to proper function of the cells, and therefore the body.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you do have high blood pressure, you will definitely want to speak with a doctor or dietician about your specific salt intake recommendations. </span>",,8704,2019-03-10 20:23:57,2019-03-11 00:23:57,closed,open,salt-is-it-really-that-bad,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,8706,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,60,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595039497,1,shared_counts_total,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

</b><b>Personal Trainer - Byward Market</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If there is one topic in the health and fitness industry that divides people most, it would probably be veganism. If you haven’t heard, a vegan diet is a 100% plant based diet. It is also associated with an entirely animal cruelty-free lifestyle. So no leather, no fur, and no products that have been tested on animals. Though not all vegans choose to make the vegan lifestyle choices. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If our ancestors were hunter gatherers, then when did we make the switch to an animal-free diet? Where did it all begin and why do some of us eat this way? Read more to find out!</span><b>In the Beginning...</b><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8716"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""177"" height=""257"" /></a><a href=""https://www.vegansociety.com/about-us/history""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Veganism</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, or strict vegetarianism, can actually be traced back as far as the time of Buddha and Pythagoras (famous philosopher and mathematician). It took time for the plant-based diet to really take hold, but in the 1800’s, people began to swear off animal products like eggs and dairy, creating a new category of dairy-free vegetarians.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the 1940’s, a man named Donald Watson got 6 non-dairy vegetarians together to discuss plant-based/animal-free food choices. They wanted to make a more clear distinction between vegetarians and a fully plant-based diet. They went through a few different words like </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">vitan</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and </span><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">benevore</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> before finally landing on vegan, which takes the first 3 and final 2 letters of vegetarian.<a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2-2.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8717 aligncenter"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""348"" height=""227"" /></a></span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since then the vegan movement has grown in popularity, with numerous documentaries like </span><a href=""https://www.forksoverknives.com/""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Forks Over Knives</span></i></a><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">,</span></i><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> being produced to showcase the health and environmental benefits of a plant-based diet.</span><b>Eats Plants - Save the Planet</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As humans have taken over the planet and the number of us has increased, we have created massive farms and complex shipping routes to deliver the food we need to stay alive, to entertain guests, and to drool over while watching</span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKqj85oo2wI""><i><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Chef’s Table</span></i></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> on Netflix. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This has created a massive industry worth just over 100 billion dollars in Canada. Unfortunately, along the way we have sacrificed the health of the planet. Human needs for energy and food have created massive amounts of carbon dioxide that is being pumped into the atmosphere, and it is changing the climate of the whole planet. Although our energy needs make up over 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions, </span><a href=""https://www.c2es.org/content/international-emissions/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">agricultural activities</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> come in second at 11%. In fact, if the emissions from cows were seen as a country, they’d be the third greatest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3-2.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8718"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""725"" height=""320"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With such massive factory farms being put up across the world, our overproduction of meat from livestock is becoming a climate issue, and not just a health issue. In November of 2018, </span><a href=""https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/10/13/why-people-in-rich-countries-are-eating-more-vegan-food""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Economist</span></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwoL6hWd4l0""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">released a video </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">which explained how a worldwide vegan movement could massively decrease greenhouse gas emissions. It brings up a few important points about how things like water consumption would be decreased, and the overall health of the population could be improved. You can watch it by clicking the hyperlink on “released a video”.</span><b>So Does Veganism Makes Sense for Human Health as well as Climate Health?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It seems to make sense for us to move to a more plant-based lifestyle if we want to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but does it make sense for optimal human health? In many of the plant-based-promoting documentaries, they typically follow an individual who is riddled with disease and taking countless medications. After following a vegan protocol, they get off of all of their meds, and many of their health issues have gone away or have been drastically reduced. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Sounds pretty great, right?</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It is! There are a few things to be understood, though, before making the switch to a fully vegan diet.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/4-2.jpg""><img class=""size-full wp-image-8719 alignleft"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/4-2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""419"" height=""764"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First of all, you will have to become very familiar with all of the </span><a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/10-surprising-food-drink-products-arent-suitable-vegans/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">foods that may use animals </span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">or animal by products in their production. The obvious ones like steak, eggs, and milk are easy to pick out, but some wines use fish bones and animal proteins in the production process, and even some pastas have animal by-products in them. So </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5598028/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">research is key.</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Include vitamins and minerals on a vegan diet in your research. Vitamin D and B12 are 2 major vitamins that quickly become depleted on a vegan diet. These are both essential to you health and deficiencies in either of these can have critical effects.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Calcium, which is readily available in greens like kale and spinach, can also quickly become depleted on a vegan diet. After 30 our body harvests calcium from the bones to be used elsewhere. Most vegans, although they are eating their dark leafy greens, still are not meeting their calcium requirements and this can lead to brittle bones and increased risk for fracture. Calcium from plants is also harder for the body to absorb, so supplementing is your best bet to keep calcium levels high. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vitamin A, the carrot vitamin, which is important for numerous bodily functions, but most notably eye health, is also a vitamin you will have to pay special attention to. When you consume a vegetable like a carrot, your body actually only gets 0%-4% of the vitamin A from the carrot (in comparison to liver, which your body absorbs 100% of the vitamin A).</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vitamin A, the carrot vitamin, which is important for numerous bodily functions, but most notably eye health, is also a vitamin you will have to pay special attention to.

Premature menopause can also occur when a woman has had radiation to the ovaries due to ovarian cancer, or if a woman has a hysterectomy. </span><b>What Changes Can We Expect?</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At this time, women’s estrogen levels have </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279311/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">been dropping</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> since their 30’s and the ovaries are now no longer producing estrogen. Estrogen has been the predominant sex hormone for the entirety of a woman’s fertile life, but it also has protective effects like maintaining healthy, strong bones and keeping the skin clear and healthy.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Symptoms of menopause include hot flashes, which are random waves of feeling hot and even sometimes sweaty. Some women experience irregular periods, and their periods may vary in the “heaviness” of their flow. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8759"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/2-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""365"" height=""483"" /></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As the hormones change, a woman’s mood can be affected as well. Some women going through perimenopause (the time 2-3 years prior and up to menopause) may experience extreme mood swings at this time, depending on the health of their hormone secreting glands and liver. Some women’s hormonal changes can actually cause some women to become depressed.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Weight gain is also a very likely (but not inevitable) symptom of menopause. When you are no longer producing estrogen in the ovaries, estrogen needs to be produced elsewhere (but in much smaller amounts). One of the ways the body does this</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5227141/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> is in the adipose tissue</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, or fat tissue of the body. In order to maintain base levels of estrogen in the body, fat tissue becomes a bit more stubborn during perimenopause and menopause.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Lastly, some women experience difficulties sleeping, or sleeping through the whole night. Every woman experiences perimenopause and menopause in her own unique way, but there are a few universal ways to prepare for menopause so that if you experience any of the symptoms they will be more manageable.</span><b>Nutrition for Menopause</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There is no perfect way to eat for everyone during menopause, but there are definitely strategies you can implement to lessen the severity of symptoms. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Women who eat plant-based diets </span><a href=""https://www.precisionnutrition.com/all-about-menopause""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">report fewer hot flashes</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. With that said, women who consumed </span><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/menopause-diet#foods-to-eat""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">more dairy and meat</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> products had better bone density post-menopause. The conclusion: eating a balanced diet of fruits and vegetables throughout your lifetime will set you up for a healthier perimenopause and postmenopause. </span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3-3.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8760"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3-3.jpg"" alt="""" width=""600"" height=""338"" /></a><a href=""https://www.precisionnutrition.com/all-about-menopause""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">High carbohydrate diets</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are also related to weight gain and mood irregularities, so sticking to complex carbohydrates like leafy green vegetables and limited simple carbs like breads, pastas, and sweets is a great way to mitigate menopausal weight gain and mood swings.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As estrogen declines, it might be useful to consume foods high in estrogens. Specifically soy and flax meal. These are both </span><a href=""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320630.php""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">phytoestrogens</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and when metabolized by the body can have protective effects for women.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To help </span><a href=""https://www.precisionnutrition.com/all-about-menopause""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">stabilize mood</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> incorporate more foods high in vitamin C like broccoli, bell peppers, citrus fruits, teas, potatoes and yams.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8761"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/5-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""664"" height=""336"" /></a><b>Foods To Avoid</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although the recommendations for helpful foods is fairly broad (whole, natural, organic foods), the foods that will inevitably make menopause more uncomfortable and increase the severity of symptoms are well-known.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As we mentioned before, you definitely want to avoid sugars and processed foods as much as possible. These foods are not great for our long-term health before menopause, and they certainly are not any better afterwards.</span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5986486/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Sugar causes inflammation in the body</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, and as your body is at a greater risk for carrying extra weight, developing osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, it is best to keep inflammatory foods at an absolute minimum. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For the</span><a href=""https://www.menopause.org/for-women/menopauseflashes/exercise-and-diet/drink-to-your-health-at-menopause-or-not""><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> coffee and alcohol</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> consumers out there the evidence is somewhat conflicted. Some studies have shown that consuming caffeine can increase the severity of hot flashes, but not increase their frequency. Some women report no changes to their hot flashes when they consume caffeine, so again we are seeing how individual the experience is for each woman. It is well reported, though, that alcohol and caffeine disrupt sleep so if catching proper Z’s is difficult during this time, it would be worth limited caffeine and alcohol consumption so you can get your much-needed sleep.</span><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-8762"" src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/6.jpg"" alt="""" width=""541"" height=""289"" /></a><a href=""https://www.webmd.com/menopause/guide/staying-healthy-through-good-nuitrition#1""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Spicy foods</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are also not recommended if you are already experiencing intense hot flashes. Spicy foods temporarily increase body temperature, so if a hot flash hits while/after eating spicy foods it could be extra-unpleasant.</span><b>Quality of Life During Menopause</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the best ways to manage menopause is to </span><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6052783/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">check in with your current lifestyle habits</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> and your environment to be sure that it is encouraging healthy and happy behaviours. Are your relationships supportive? Are your getting lots of sunshine and rest? Are your consuming enough water and taking time to meditate/check in with your inner well-being?</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If any of the above-mentioned things are not acting to support your happiness in life, then it will only make menopause more difficult. </span>",,8757,2019-03-27 20:50:43,2019-03-28 00:50:43,closed,open,menopause-one-hot-topic,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_edit_last,5,_thumbnail_id,8759,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,sbg_selected_sidebar,"a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}",sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,"a:1:{i:0;s:15:""Default Sidebar"";}",_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595062110,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,Can Seed Cycling Improve Your Cycle? - Free Form Fitness,,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/can-seed-cycling-improve-your-cycle/,45.56.103.142,2019-04-01 17:48:50,2019-04-01 21:48:50,[&#8230;] that some foods like flax and soy are high in compounds known as phytoestrogens.

To each woman that will mean something different, so it is important to say that seed cycling will have varying effects on women, and that the effects of seed cycling are targeting the hormonal changes during a typical 28-day cycle. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So what is seed cycling? Read more to find out!<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>The Root of Seed Cycling</strong>In nutrition science it is well known that some foods like flax and soy are high in compounds known as <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/phytoestrogens"">phytoestrogens</a>. In last week’s <a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/menopause-one-hot-topic/"">article</a> we briefly mentioned that consuming phytoestrogenic foods can have protective effects on a woman. In <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8077314"">one study</a> they looked at the effects of these phytoestrogenic foods (specifically flax seeds) within the different phases of a woman’s cycle. What they discovered was a slight increase in testosterone during the mid-follicular phase, and a higher progesterone/estragen ratio in the luteal phase (you can refer to the image below to understand this a little better).</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":8780} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-8780""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Higher testosterone levels typically presents itself as a higher sex-drive in women (hence the slightly bump around ovulation to give women a little extra encouragement). </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The higher progesterone/estragen ratio is also significant. When women have a low progesterone/estradiol ratio in the latter phase of their cycle, this could be an indication of <a href=""https://www.fluidsiq.com/pdfs/Female%20Wellness%20Understanding%20Hormone%20Excess%20and%20Deficiency.pdf"">estrogen dominance</a>, which is a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1868925/"">risk factor</a> for developing breast cancer, ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, infertility, and miscarriages. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>By consuming flax seeds and pumpkin seeds during the follicular phase of your cycle, you support healthy production of estrogen and encourage healthier levels of progesterone in the luteal phase. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>What About the Luteal Phase?</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So if phytoestrogens support the first half of the cycle, then what supports progesterone production for the second half of the cycle? </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With seed cycling, it is less-so about directly targeting progesterone, and more so about estrogen. For the luteal phase when women want to have that high progesterone-estradiol ratio, they should aim to consume foods that keep estrogen levels normal (not high), and help to detox the body as it naturally begins to prepare for a new cycle (a detox-ing in its own right).</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Sesame seeds and sunflower seeds are the perfect options for this part of the cycle. Sesame seeds have <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/136/5/1270/4669984"">been shown</a> to have a controlling effect on estrogen, blocking excess production of the hormone. Sunflower seeds fill out the other part of this as they are high in the micronutrient selenium, which is important for <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5295066/"">liver detoxification</a>. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":8781} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-8781""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>So How and Why Should You Start?</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It’s very simple to begin seed cycling.

In 2011, Dr. William Davis released the book “Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health”. This was at the peak of the gluten-free craze as it’s popularity has been steadily rising from 2004 at a rate of 28%. Celebrities all tried it and began to advocate for its health benefits, with the body-transformation champion, Khloe Kardashian at the helm. While we all contemplate trying keto, or paleo, or veganism, or whatever diet is the latest trend in the news, have we forgotten about enemy number 2 (after falsely-accused fat)? Should we worry about gluten again? Could gluten have suffered the same fate as fats did in the 70’s? Read more to find out!</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Where Did Gluten Come From?</strong><br>Gluten is the storage protein of wheat grains. It is a complicated network of proteins and comes in many forms like gliadin (wheat), secalin (rye), hordein (barley), and avenin (oats). Gluten has been in the human diet for years and it’s ability to make a small amount of wheat, water, and salt into a loaf of bread to feed a family with quality nutrients meant that we celebrated this protein. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Unfortunately, with the introduction of industrial farming and the shift to using genetically modified seeds, we are now consuming gluten in foods besides bread and this gluten is not the gluten of our ancestors.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Gluten-Free Diet : Fad or Factual?</strong><br><br>Consuming a gluten-free diet is absolutely essential for individuals with diagnosed celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Celiac disease is actually an autoimmune disorder (meaning the bodies immune system will act against the specific tissues in the body). This is incredibly serious, and can even be life-threatening if it goes undiagnosed. For the rest of the population who do not have celiac disease or NCGS, is the gluten-free diet really everything the diet books tell us?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Elephant in the Room</strong><br><br>Let’s get this out of the way right away - can the gluten-free diet help us to lose unwanted weight? The research is mixed. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In studies where they implemented a gluten-free diet for celiac patients, some say that BMI improved and all patients lost weight. Another study looked at patient records from 1991 to 2007 and found that between their first record and their final record, the incidence of obesity in patients almost doubled from 11% to 21%.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>So which one is it? </strong><br>For both of these studies, the gluten-free diet was being integrated into a celiac individual’s life. Going gluten-free was out of necessity and not for the purpose of weight-loss. In fact, the second study mentioned was urging for better nutritional follow-up to ensure that when celiac individuals switch to a gluten-free diet that they are paying attention to their nutrition and not just eating bags of those chocolate covered glutino pretzels!</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As with many major dietary changes, an individual’s decision to switch to a gluten-free diet may lead to weight-loss simply because they are becoming more conscious of what they are eating. So much of the eating we do in a day is unconscious and so we end up consuming too much, too little, or too much junk. By making an effort to eat a certain way, people are more likely to make other healthy choices as well. Remember - the best diet is the one you stick to! So yes, a gluten-free diet can help you lose weight if the rest of your diet is also getting re-evaluated and updated. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Other Benefits of Gluten-Free Eatin</strong>g</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Gluten is found is a lot of food like soy sauce, beer, licorice, imitation crab meats, canned soups, and malt products, so when someone decides to go gluten-free and they commit to absolutely no foods with gluten, then they will likely begin to eat a more whole-food diet. Eating more whole-foods means better nutrient density and quality, and a more balanced diet. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>A gluten-free diet can also help those with irritable bowel syndrome. The best way to manage IBS is by following a low FODMAP diet (fermentable oligo-,di-, monosaccharides and polyols). When gluten is consumed, it is easily fermented by the bacteria in the gut which can lead to painful cramping, bloating, and gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea and constipation. So if you know you have IBS, then cutting out gluten from your life can be a good option for you!</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Can a Gluten-Free Diet Be Bad For You?</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In some cases choosing to go gluten-free can have negative effects. Gluten from crops is also associated with important sources of fiber and iron, so if you go gluten-free and don’t seek out suitable alternatives for these then you could run into health problems. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Going gluten-free when you don’t have a medical reason to also limits the variety of food you can consume. Studies have shown that the more restrictive your diet, the greater your chances of having depression. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So before you revisit the gluten-free craze, think about what you’re really looking for? If weight-loss is the goal, then a gluten-free diet could help you get there - but a balanced diet of whole foods can as well. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We have to stress that we are not dieticians or doctors, so any nutritional advice we provide on the blog is not meant to treat disease or act as a prescription.

In the picture above they are little dots, but in reality they look like this:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":8945} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-1.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-8945""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So if you are going to get bigger you can either increase the cell space, or actually increase the number of contractile components (the parts of the muscle that will do the work).</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.strongerbyscience.com/sarcoplasmic-vs-myofibrillar-hypertrophy/""><strong>Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy</strong></a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Research is mixed on how sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is accomplished long-term, but in the short-term, sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is essentially “the pump”. Taking supplements like creatine, working a high volume program, blood-flow restriction training, and carb-loading can all cause this swelling of the muscle. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So if you’re looking for a quick, non-functional (less strength associated with this kind of hypertrophy) pump, then you could combine all of these techniques for maximum <em>pump-age.</em></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This kind of muscle growth is also seen in the elderly. Many of us know that as we get older our ability to gain muscle/strength decreases. You can still gain a small amount of size as you get older as your bodies ability to adapt this way slows at a slower rate than the ability to adapt by-way of myofibrillar hypertrophy. So although your ability to increase myofibril count decreases as you age, your ability to increase sarcoplasmic space is decreasing at a slower rate.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a25252586/muscle-hypertrophy/""><strong>Myofibrillar Hypertrophy</strong></a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This second form of muscle growth is the one that really counts. The muscle adapts by incorporating more contractile proteins so, not only does the size of the muscle fiber grow, but it also gets stronger. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This type of muscle growth is accomplished with very specific training, as well as proper nutrition, recovery, and a sprinkle of genetics - but we will get to those next week.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are A LOT, and we mean <strong><em>A LOT</em></strong> of programs out there all claiming they will help you “gain the most size ever, and you’ll be super ripped and huge for beach season.”</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>But what is <strong><em>the best</em></strong> way to encourage this type of muscle adaptation?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In fitness programs and personal training certification courses we are taught a generic formula for the 3 different training goals. 1-5 reps &amp; heavy load will lead to strength gains. 6-15 reps and heavy to moderate weight will lead to hypertrophy. Anything over 15 will lead to endurance adaptations. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>But is it so black and white? Should you only train in the 6-15 rep range if you want to increase muscle mass?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30153194"">study</a> published in the Journal of Medicine and Science in Sport and Exercise, 34 healthy and trained men were put into three different training groups. The breakdown was essentially low volume, moderate volume, and maximum volume. The men trained for 8 weeks. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the end, all men had some hypertrophy. The only place where there was greater hypertrophy associated with higher volume was in the elbow flexors (biceps) and the thighs. So if you’re looking for bicep and thigh gains, then maximizing volume (reps x sets x weight) could be the key. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So what about the perfect program? </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One of the 7 training principles in personal training is <strong>individuality</strong>. This is why we always stress with exercise and dietary recommendations that you need to find what works for <strong><em>you</em></strong>. For those who are just starting off, simply lifting weights consistently should help put on size. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you have been training for a long time and your hypertrophy has dropped off, you may need to be a bit more resourceful with your training. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Dr. Layne Norton, a well-known weightlifter, and somewhat controversial figure in the fitness industry, designed a program known as the <a href=""http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html"">PHAT program</a>. PHAT stands for power hypertrophy adaptive training. The program takes both power-style training techniques, as well as strength and hypertrophy style training to give your muscles the most stimulus possible to promote hypertrophy. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Dr. Norton’s program highlights a key point around hypertrophy. There needs to be a varying stimulus in order to maximize muscle growth. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you were building a house, you could make it all out of wood - this would be like following a straight hypertrophy program (6-15 reps, moderate weight). In the end you’ll still end up with a house. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Or - you could build a house with wood, steel, plaster, and a number of other materials. In the end the result is the same - a house. But the one built with many more materials is more robust and uses as many of the available resources possible to build the house. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Working with your trainer, who has a better understanding of your training level, nutrition, and lifestyle, is key to achieving the goal of hypertrophy. They can put together a program that is specifically designed to your individual needs, and training history, so you can maximize your muscle growth. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Next week we will look at how nutrition can affect your ability to put on size.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,8943,2019-04-14 16:10:59,2019-04-14 20:10:59,closed,open,a-special-recipe-for-muscle-mass-part-1-weight-training,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_edit_last,4,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,xyz_fbap,1,_thumbnail_id,8945,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595366150,1,shared_counts_total,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,A Special Recipe for Muscle Mass: Part 1 – Weight Training - Spotile,,https://spotile.com/2019/04/a-special-recipe-for-muscle-mass-part-1-weight-training/,147.135.5.233,2019-05-02 12:19:27,2019-05-02 16:19:27,[&#8230;] Read Full Post Here  [&#8230;],0,pingback,0,0,3.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As far as skeletal muscle hypertrophy goes, there are limited studies on how fat affects muscle hypertrophy and what the specific recommendations are.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There is <a href=""https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00837.2015"">one study,</a> however, that observed whether rats on a low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet would experience the same hypertrophy or not after exercise.

You do not need supplements to gain muscle, but they can be included in your hypertrophy nutrition protocol to advance your gains.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We have mentioned a few times in this article that essential amino acids are an important part of promoting muscle protein synthesis during and after exercise. Just 6g of essential amino acids can increase muscle protein synthesis. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Protein powder is also a popular post-workout supplement. Although not necessary, especially if you are eating whole foods that are high in protein, protein powders usually provide these essential amino acids. The exception would be some vegan proteins (although most are now formulated to have all of the essential amino acids), and collagen protein. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Although collagen protein is a great protein supplement, especially for your joints and skin health, it only has 8 out of the 9 essential amino acids, and is therefore not a complete protein source.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":8958} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/5.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-8958""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As mentioned before, creatine is also a great supplement to take when you are looking to encourage protein synthesis.

76,A Special Recipe for Muscle Mass: Genetics & Recovery,https://freeformfitness.ca/a-special-recipe-for-muscle-mass-genetics-recovery/,"Sun, 05 May 2019 15:29:13 +0000",Ashley,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=9006,"<!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Author: Riley Pearce</strong><br><strong>Social Media Director</strong><br><strong>Personal Trainer - Byward Market</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For the final portion of our muscle building series we have the often-overlooked factors of recovery and genetics. The fact is, not every person has the same genetic makeup and therefore every individual will respond to diet and exercise in their own individual way. Recovery will also be different for individuals based on their training level. This is why beginners require 2 or 3 days between workouts, whereas athletes can train twice a day for several hours. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Before we get too far it is important to mention that although genetics can make putting on size easier for some, and more difficult for others, <strong><em>hard work always pays off</em></strong>. So if you are genetically designed to be an ectomorph (long and lean), put in the work and you <em>will</em> put on size.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Muscle-Fiber Type</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In our &nbsp;muscles there are actually <a href=""https://www.ptdirect.com/training-design/anatomy-and-physiology/skeletal-muscle-2013-anatomy-and-fiber-types"">3 types</a> of muscle fiber types. Your baseline concentration of these is pre-determined by your genetic makeup. There are slow-twitch fibers, which contract slowly but can continue to contract for a long time. For athletes who are trained in endurance sports, they typically have more slow-twitch fibers in their muscles that support that type of exercise.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Then we have the fast-twitch fibers A. These muscle fibers can use both oxygen and glucose to contract. This makes them optimal for exercises in the 8-12 rep range, or mid-range events like the 400m sprint. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The final muscle fiber type is fast-twitch B. These are used in our explosive movements. So if you are doing a single clean and snatch, or the 100m sprint, then your are likely using these muscle fibers.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9007,""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9007""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We are all born with different amounts of each of these muscle fiber types in our bodies. This will influence the body’s ability to put on size. Type 1 fibers, the endurance muscle fibers, don’t want to grow because that would add bulk to the muscle. If you are going to be running for a long period of time, you want efficient muscles, not bulky muscles that will weigh you down.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9008,""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9008""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>On the flip side, if you look at 100m sprinters, their muscles are typically larger than their marathoning friends because they need as many of those explosive muscle fiber types to propel them forward the fastest.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9009,""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9009""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you have always found that you stayed lean no matter how hard you trained, you likely have a greater concentration of the slow-twitch fibers. If you are the kind of person who puts on muscle with minimal effort, chances are you have a larger concentration of the fast-twitch B fibers. If you’re somewhere in the middle, then you probably fall under the fast-twitch A category.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Again - this does not condemn you to one body type for the rest of your life. The human body is built to adapt, so if you are constantly giving your body the right stimulus to build muscle, you will eventually put on muscle no matter what muscle fiber type you have more of.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>All this to say, if you know you how your body has been responding to exercise up to this point, use this information to clarify how you will progress. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Recovery</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Recovery is so critical to progress. If you look at the graph below, every training stimulus puts us into a declined state of fitness. When we take time to recover, the body adapts and actually super compensates in order to be ready for the next bout of training.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9010} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/4.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9010""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So if we train without allowing for time to recover, we can never get into the supercompensation area of the graph and will actually see a decline in fitness. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The actual time you take to recover will vary depending on your fitness level. If you are a beginner, then the general guidelines are to take at least 48 hours before working the same muscle group again.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For people who have been training for a while, one of the adaptations their body has made is that the time it takes to recover is much shorter. This is why athletes can train twice a day for hours. It is typically 2 different types of training stimuli, but they have the energy for it.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9011} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9011""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The above graph includes a very important aspect of recovery. It isn’t just about not exercising. If you want to get the most out of your recovery, and therefore experience the most muscle gains, then your recovery plan needs to include hydration, sleep, and supportive nutrition.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With our 3-part series on hypertrophy coming to a close, we should summarize: </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For exercise, your fitness level will dictate how specific your training needs to be. If you are new, you will likely experience hypertrophic adaptations no matter what your rep and set scheme looks like. As long as you are challenging yourself. The more advanced you are, the more advanced the programming should be. Combine a mixture of power, hypertrophy, and strength training to get the most out of your training.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For nutrition, protein will be critical. Your body needs protein to help rebuild the muscles. You should also have carbohydrates to give the body the energy it needs to complete the workouts. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>And finally, for genetics and recovery. Although we are all born with a set number of the different muscle fiber types, this does not mean you will only ever respond to certain types of exercise. Work hard and the body will adapt accordingly, it just may take more time. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Your recovery is the final piece of the hypertrophy puzzle. Recognize where your fitness level is, and adjust your recovery accordingly. Don’t over-work the muscles without giving them ample time to recover. And of course, remember to include nutrition, sleep, and hydration in your recovery plan.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9006,2019-05-05 11:29:13,2019-05-05 15:29:13,closed,open,a-special-recipe-for-muscle-mass-genetics-recovery,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9008,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,1,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595335232,30,shared_counts_total,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,A Special Recipe for Muscle Mass: Genetics &amp; Recovery - Spotile,,https://spotile.com/2019/05/a-special-recipe-for-muscle-mass-genetics-recovery/,172.104.245.184,2019-05-08 22:26:47,2019-05-09 02:26:47,[&#8230;] Read Full Post Here  [&#8230;],0,pingback,0,0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But is there merit to this claim? And can we truly compare it to the detrimental health effects of smoking? Read on to find out.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Where Did this Come From?</strong>In a quick Google search, I found many articles warning about the threat of sitting to our health. A few pages in I found an article back from 2013 from the <a href=""https://hbr.org/2013/01/sitting-is-the-smoking-of-our-generation"">Harvard Business Review</a> with the headline, “Sitting is the Smoking of Our Generation”. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9025} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1-1.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9025""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>According to one article, the number of articles and research papers published talking about the threat of sitting in comparison to our health increased 12-fold between the years of 2012 and 2016. Which could have sprung from the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17sitting-t.html?_r=0"">New York Time</a>s article in 2011 titled, “Is Sitting a Lethal Activity?”</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9026} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2-1.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9026""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Turns out this idea that sedentary lifestyle can negatively affect our health has been around since the late 90’s.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>The Research</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Between 1999 and 2000 a large scale study was published detailing the metabolic effects of sedentary behaviour. Sitting and general sedentary behaviour can affect the body in a few different ways.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list --><ul><li>Metabolic rate slows. To help conserve energy while we are doing nothing, the body adapts by slowing down the metabolism. This is why snacking at your desk can be a major factor in sneaky weight gain.</li><li>The production of the enzymes that clean up the blood vessels of harmful cholesterol and free fatty acids declines. So by sitting, you are putting yourself at a higher risk for developing cardiovascular disease.</li><li>Sitting affects your blood glucose levels as well, as the body is less efficient at producing the insulin required to lower blood-glucose levels. This puts you at a higher risk for obesity and developing type 2 diabetes.</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9027} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3-1.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9027""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404815/"">The research </a>also shows that even if you are meeting the guidelines for 150 min/week of moderate-vigorous physical activity, but then spending the rest of your time sitting, that all of these negative effects will still occur. If you’re a woman, the research showed that these consequences of sitting are more extreme in women than in men.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>The Upside to the Research</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There is some hope for those of you who are desk bound for work, or find yourself on long-haul flights or drives for work.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Even the slightest bit of extra movement, as simple as bending down to tie your shoe, can cut into the sitting time and protect you from the harmful effects of a sedentary lifestyle.

Especially when articles are starting to suggest that smoking is <em>less</em> harmful than sitting. If you had a sample size of 100,000 people, about 190 excess (unnecessary) deaths would occur from sitting. For smoking that number is 2000 excess <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6187798/"">deaths</a>. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So obviously smoking is not good for our health - this is something we should all be aware of. Is it fair to compare sitting to smoking in a literal way? Probably not. But for the sake of shock-value, grouping sitting in with smoking as a health risk helps us understand just how bad this simple part of life can be. We should not take inactivity lightly, and should all start emphasizing more movement everyday. That does not mean adding a 5k run to your day, although that would certainly help. It can be as simple as tying your shoe.

Why are we bringing those two up together? Turns out the body produces cannabinoids - molecules also found in cannabis - within our own bodies. These are known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocannabinoid_system"">endocannabinoids</a> (<em>endo </em>meaning <em>within/internal)</em>, as they are cannabinoids produced within the body. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9122,""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1-2.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9122""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>According to a recent study, a higher concentration of cannabinoids found in the gut can actually lead to overeating. This has to do with the signals that our gut sends to our brain to let us know that we are satiated.In every human, there is something known as the <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/circadian_rhythm.htm"">circadian rhythm</a>. Many people have heard of this as it relates to our sleep and the various sleep stages we go through. But the circadian rhythm is actually a full-day cycle and includes not only sleep and melatonin, but also cortisol, leptin and ghrelin.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9124,""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/2-2.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9124""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As you move through the different sleep stages, your body is eventually triggered to wake up due to an increase in cortisol (most well-known as the stress hormone). Lights, sounds, and sometimes what you ate the night before can trigger this rise in cortisol. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The cortisol helps to wake you up and prepares the body to take on the day and all of the activities that you have planned. Within an hour or two of waking up the brain will receive its first signal from the gut telling the brain that it is hungry and requires nutrients. This comes in the form of ghrelin (think of a <em>ghrumbly</em> stomach). </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>You’ll typically experience hunger pains when this happens and you find yourself looking through the fridge for your first meal of the day. Once you’ve started to eat, the body will eventually send another signal to the brain in the form of leptin. Leptin tells the brain that the body has enough nutrients to get through the next bout of activity.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The more fat stored on your body, the more leptin your body should be producing and storing. Fat is a form of energy storage, so if you do decide to eat, then leptin should kick in faster than someone who carries less fat on their body. This is a mechanism that was designed to help humans eat only what they needed to in order to survive.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Nowadays we can ignore those feelings of satiety and essentially turn off the leptin signal.

I needed to get back into shape and help overcome a back injury I’d sustained after years of neglect and lots of picking up things awkwardly…like my children. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>What was your initial goal when you joined?</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>I wanted to strengthen my core and help my back feel better.

But there’s a Free Form right around the corner from my work in <a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/ottawa/kanata/"">Kanata</a>, and the trainers have made it easy by accommodating my schedule. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Have you experienced success at Free Form Fitness?

84,Why Are We Addicted to Sugar?,https://freeformfitness.ca/why-are-we-addicted-to-sugar/,"Mon, 01 Jul 2019 12:51:02 +0000",Ashley,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=9163,"<!-- wp:image {""id"":9164,""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1.jpg"" alt=""person sitting at a table full of candy. The person is licking their lips and holding a spoonful of sugar."" class=""wp-image-9164""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The majority of us are addicts and we may not even realize it. Addiction, by definition is when we are physically and mentally dependent on a particular substance, and unable to stop taking it without incurring adverse effects.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This seems like a pretty serious thing and is more formally associated with substances like drugs and alcohol. Addictions can happen with any kind of substance, including everyday food items, sex, and gambling.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Sugar is one of the most addictive food substances that we consume. In fact, sugar is 8 times more addictive than cocaine, a well-known addictive drug.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you really think about it, it makes sense. Sugar is in everything - fruits, pastas, breads, sweets, baked goods, beverages. We are giving ourselves a hit of sugar every day, and the food industry knows it so they continue to sneak more sugar into our food. This is why going on a “carb-free” diet can be so difficult. Your body will literally go through withdrawals from the constant flow of simple sugars.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So how does sugar addiction work and is there a way to overcome it?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are 3 parts to addictive behaviour. The first is bingeing. Bingeing is when an individual consumes a particular substance, in large quantities, in one sitting. This behaviour could have some evolutionary roots as our ancestors would be encouraged to consume as much of these brain-boosting substances at one time to maximize the amount of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurochemical in the brain that is associated with a happy, and “high” feeling in large enough quantities. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9165,""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2.jpg"" alt=""Image of the brain highlighting the basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, and extended amygdala. Around the brain is a cycle explaining the the basal ganglia controls the need to binge, then the extended amygdala produces feelings of withdrawal and negative Affect, and finally the prefrontal cortex controls our feelings of preoccupation and anticipation"" class=""wp-image-9165""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The second is withdrawal. This is typically shown through anxiety and irritability and will occur after avoidance or forced deprivation from an addictive substance.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The final part is cravings. When we crave something our motivation to attain that substance is increased. People will do crazy things and convince themselves they really need sugar when their cravings are at an all-time high.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As you read through this you may already recognize that you have experienced these 3 phases of addiction with sugar. You may have been on a diet, and have been “really good” lately, then something major happens - a stressful day at work or something like that and all of a sudden you find yourself in the candy aisle at the grocery store. You pick up not one, but 2 kinds of candy. Then you go home and consume those 2 bags of candy before you’ve even chosen your Netflix movie for the night.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9167,""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3.jpg"" alt=""Cycle of addiction wheel"" class=""wp-image-9167""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This narrative is actually representative of another aspect of addiction and that is sensitization. We see this with things like smoking and alcohol - one behaviour or substance leads to the next because they work on similar brain pathways. Stressful work-days put our brain in a state where it craves a boost. Bingeing will release a ton of that neurochemical dopamine, and provide us with the calming “high” we need to forget about whatever was stressing us out.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The second half of that story is an important one to look at as well. After bingeing, we feel guilty. We know that sugar is not good for our long term health, so we vow to never do that again. Then comes withdrawal. The day after bingeing you may feel lethargic, irritable, depressed, or anxious. Then your brain remembers something that pulls you out of that “funk”.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Enter cravings.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It is a vicious cycle that many of us don’t even realize we are perpetuating by constantly dieting, or giving into those cravings.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9168,""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/4.jpg"" alt=""Person sitting at a table wit candy and a pile of white sugar. The person is about to eat a whole spoonful of sugar."" class=""wp-image-9168""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So can we kick the sugar addiction?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Yes, and thankfully it doesn’t have to happen the way drug addictions are kicked by full, 100% removal.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Over time our palates have been conditioned to crave more sweet-ness. Even if you are using artificial sweeteners, your brain expects and wants your food to be a certain level of sweetness or else it is dissatisfying.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So in order to reduce our sugar intake, we need to slowly train our brain to want less-sweet food. This is common practice for people who want to switch from a daily double-double, to a black coffee. First, you order a 2-cream, 1 sugar. The coffee will taste different, but the more you expose your tastebuds to this coffee, the more they will get used to it. Then you drop it down to 2 cream, no sugar. Again you will have to adjust to the taste of this coffee, but eventually you won’t even notice the difference until you have finally gotten yourself down to drinking just black coffee.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Maybe it isn’t too many sugars in your coffee, but just too many sweets too often. Reflect on the past week and think about all the times you had bread, pasta, desserts, sodas, sweet coffees, or sweet snacks. For the next week, cut that down by a day. Then every week cut it down by another day until you are only having those sweets every now and then.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Not ready to give up your granola bars or yogurt? Try finding a similar product that has less sugar. A great example is the quaker granola bars and kashi granola bars. You still get that granola bar snack in your day, but your body will learn to not need the high-sugar granola bar.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Similar to how your body will find a workout difficult in the beginning, but over time and training workouts get easier, you can train your tastebuds to crave less sweet-ness. You just need to take the time to make a plan and find where your weaknesses lie and where you can start to cut back on your sugar intake.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9169,""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5.jpg"" alt=""Yes baby meme - Reads: When you realize you conquered your addiction to sugar"" class=""wp-image-9169""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the case of sugar, abstinence or complete forced deprivation will only lead to bingeing. So this slow-and-steady training approach is a more balanced approach to reducing your sugar intake levels.<em>Read the full literary review on sugar addiction </em><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235907/""><em>here</em></a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""small""} --><p class=""has-small-font-size""><strong>Author: <a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/team/riley-pearce/"">Riley Pearce</a></strong><br><strong>Social Media Director</strong><br><strong>Personal Trainer - Byward Market</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9163,2019-07-01 08:51:02,2019-07-01 12:51:02,closed,open,why-are-we-addicted-to-sugar,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9164,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,60,shared_counts,,shared_counts_datetime,1594935590,shared_counts_total,14,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,,,,,,,,_snap_forceSURL,2,,,,,,,snap_MYURL,,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_focuskw,addicted to sugar,_yoast_wpseo_metadesc,"Learn more about why humans are addicted to sugar, and what you can do to help control and better manage your own addiction to sugar.",_yoast_wpseo_linkdex,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
85,Can the Mind Really Heal the Body?,https://freeformfitness.ca/can-the-mind-really-heal-the-body/,"Sun, 07 Jul 2019 23:16:15 +0000",Ashley,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=9179,"<!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Author: Riley Pearce</strong><br><strong>Social Media Director</strong><br><strong>Personal Trainer - Byward Market</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>On the Free Form Fitness blog we typically stay within the realm of medical, research based, tried-and-true fitness, nutrition, and lifestyle topics. For this week we would like to venture into the world of self-healing with the mind.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Netflix released a documentary this year called “<a href=""http://www.healdocumentary.com/"">Heal</a>”, which introduced audiences to several people who had managed to heal injuries, and cure illnesses with a resource we don’t typically turn to in the time of modern medicine - the brain. One man rebuilt his spine after a nasty injury, and another woman took control of the cancer in her body. The stories are amazing and almost unbelievable.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It seems crazy to think that just by thinking about healing that we <em>may actually be able to heal ourselves.</em></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Before we go any further, it must be said that this is all speculative and methods are mostly anecdotal. We are not giving medical advice, we are simply presenting an area of research within the health and wellness community. These types of strategies should be seen as additional resources and options, but you should always consult with a licensed professional before choosing alternative treatments for any kind of injury or illness.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So is there really a connection between body mind, and is the body interwoven enough with the mind that the mind can actually influence the body?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are a few key examples of this that don’t even involve healing, but show the powerful connection between how we think and how we feel.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The first is the well-known “white-coat hypertension”. This is a phenomenon that doctors observed in their patients and would wrongly perscribe blood-pressure medication for. It has been shown that blood pressure can rise when in the presence of someone in a white lab coat, most commonly associated with doctors. The simple stress of seeing the doctor is enough to increase blood pressure. Seeing the doctor, considering the potential outcomes of the meeting, and creating a mindset of stress has the power to increase the blood pressure of people with otherwise normal blood pressure readings. Just think about that and then move onto this next example.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are individuals with something known as multiple personality disorder. These people truly believe that they are 2 or more people in one. Doctors have observed a patient with this disorder who had one personality that was allergic to oranges and would break out in hives every time they drank orange juice. When they were their “other selves”, orange juice wouldn’t affect them at all. If they were in the mind of the one with the orange allergy, drank orange juice, broke out in hives, and then switched to their other mind, the hives would disappear. Multiple personality disorder is a great example of how the true belief in a certain state of being can influence the physical state of being.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Finally there is the placebo effect. This <em>is</em> a well known area of scientific research and is likely the strongest argument for the mind-body connection and the power of mind-body healing. Patients are given a placebo, or a version of a drug that is actually just a sugar pill, and by simply believing that the pill will be the magic treatment to cure their illness, they are “magically” cured.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Our brain is incredibly complex and is the reason why we have become the dominant species on this planet. It’s awesome computational powers have designed rocket ships, electric cars, and beyond meat burgers. So it should come as no surprise that if we turn that power in on ourselves that we could cause some impressive changes within ourselves.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One study even showed that individuals who visualized themselves lifting weights and putting on muscle increased their muscle mass by 24%! Exercising obviously will bring about more change, but the research just shows how strong the mind really is!</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We even see these effects in different types of employment. If you work is controlling, too structured, and high stress, then your body will suffer by way of existing in a constant state of stress and inflammation. Chronic inflammation is the first step towards disease.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>To contrast that, if your job allows for more creativity, gives you more control of your hours, and gives you a sense of purpose, chances are you will live longer because you are not living in a constant state of stress.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are tons of examples of our mind and our thoughts influencing our physical state. Institutions are now starting to recognize the potentially powerful effects of mind-body healing and some schools are even including it in their curriculum.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Is it the new cure-all? Tough to say at the moment.

Or maybe you’ve always been around the same bodyweight, even when you have wild weekends of indulgences? Turns out this could be due to a biological “set point” that controls our body weight.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Similarly to how we have a temperature set point that our body is constantly trying to maintain, we could also have a body weight set point as well.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This theory came from a mice study in the 1940’s. Researchers manipulated different areas of the hypothalamus and each manipulation resulted in a drastic change in the mice body composition. In one case, the researchers created an “injury” to the part of the hypothalamus closer to the midbrain. Those mice quickly became obese. Then the researchers simulated lesions on the outer portion of the hypothalamus and those mice became very slim to the point of refusing the eat.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9198} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-2.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9198""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This study suggested that there are controls within the brain that work on a type of feedback loop to control the amount of fat storage on the body, and therefore the body weight of an individual. In a world with normal amounts of food and resources, this control system would keep just enough fat stored on the body to keep us alive in times of abundance and in times of starvation.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Fortunately and unfortunately the modern, western world lives in a constant state of abundance. Our endless access to food means that we are overfeeding ourselves and moving the set point higher and higher the more occasions we overeat.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9199} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3-1.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9199""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Why doesn’t it work in the opposite direction - ie. if we constantly limit our food, our set point moves lower? This is because fat is a form of survival, energy and nutrient storage. Our environment has evolved faster than our brains and our bodies have, so the brain and the body still prioritize fat storage so we can survive between hunts and through the long dark winters. It will always favour fat storage over low body fat percentage because that’s what kept us alive “back in the day”.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With all of that taken into consideration - is it possible to overcome the set point?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Simple answer is yes, but it is conditional.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The key is training the body and brain to trust that the new diet and exercise routine (calories in and calories out) is the new normal.

Starving and over exercising for a short period of time will only upset the regulatory systems in the body and bring you right back to your set-point (and potentially to a new, higher one!).</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Most research suggests that sticking to a specific, nutrient-rich, non-calorie-restrictive diet, coupled with a regular and consistent exercise routine is the best option to reset your set point. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The research also says that <strong><em>at least</em></strong> a year of this is required to begin to move that set point, but this could vary depending on how long you have lived at a certain weight.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In summary:&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Yes the set point may actually exist and it could be the reason you find it difficult to maintain lost or gained weight. If we find ourselves constantly overeating, we could push that set point higher and higher, making our new “normal” much heavier than we may like.

The kind of magic that puts mushrooms and other fungi into the coveted club of superfoods?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are several cultures across the globe that have been harnessing the healthy powers of mushrooms for years, and The West has finally taken notice. With brands like Four Sigmatic offering several varieties of mushrooms in powder form, these powerful plants are making their way into the kitchens of the curious and health conscious.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Is there any real health benefit and should you jump on the mushroom bandwagon? Read more to find out!</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Mushrooms are not some new health fad designed by the diet industry.

But how are they for simple nutritional value? How will they affect our macros and can they help us get our crucial vitamins and minerals?&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>After all of the health benefits that have already been discussed, it should come as no surprise that these little forest fungi have an impressive nutrient profile. Mushrooms are one of the only non-animal sources of vitamin D.

Companies are all jumping on the lucrative bandwagon of health and trying to sell you the next best weight loss solution. If it isn’t food companies, there are news sources constantly talking about what the latest diet is that will help us all look our very best.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There is an issue with this constant bombardment of diet mentality. We can no longer see food as food. Food has become a validation of our morality (“I was so good today - I only had one cookie!”); it has become the cause of an increase or decrease on the scale; and our food choices have even become social currency because if you’re following the latest diet you become part of a larger community.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Food began as fuel. We need food to grow, to move, to think, and to heal. This is why many dieticians are turning to intuitive eating as a new solution to diet culture and the anxieties it has perpetuated in our society.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Intuitive eating is exactly as it sounds - you eat as you think you should. It is the return to listening to the body and what it is asking you for.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Many people when they first begin the intuitive eating way of life find themselves eating things like fast food, pizza, sweets, and take-out. At first this may seem unnerving because we have it burned into our minds that those are “bad” foods and we should feel guilty when we eat them because they will make us unhealthy and gain weight.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Although it is true that many of the above-mentioned foods have very little nutritional value, and therefore provide you with nothing more than a moment of gratification, and an evening of stomach aches, this part of the process is important.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This initial stage is all about letting go of the rules. Eat what you want and don’t stress about whether it is good or bad.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The next stage is to start listening. We have become so obsessed with how food will affect us externally (body shape, social aspect), that we have lost touch with how it affects us on the inside. What’s worse is this preoccupation with food, and obsession with dieting has actually made dieting a predictor of 5 year weight gain, and has decreased our own feelings of self-worth.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As your path to undieting progresses, you’ll start to realize that there are foods that give you lots of energy, and there are foods that make you feel glued to the couch. There will be foods that keep your brain sharp, and foods that leave you feeling foggy and not like yourself. Some food will even affect your skin or the way you smell, while other foods will simply leave you dissatisfied and wanting more. Participants of studies on intuitive eating actually find that over time not only do they begin to understand how food directly affects them, but they begin to rediscover their self-worth and trust themselves around food anymore. The reactive and impulsive behaviours slowly begin to disappear and it is liberating.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9236} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-4.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9236""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The body is amazing at self-regulating but we have to let it self-regulate. Think about babies when they feed. Babies only feed when they want, and will stop eating once they are full. This intuition around how much and when food is needed is something we are all born with. Unfortunately, as we get older and therefore experience more of diet culture, it becomes increasingly harder to hear those hunger and satiety signals over the sounds of ads, social pressures, and our own inner critic.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><em>Resources used for this article:</em></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6360478/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6360478/</a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28718396"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28718396</a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5702316/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5702316/</a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9234,2019-07-30 17:31:23,2019-07-30 21:31:23,closed,open,is-un-dieting-the-solution-to-our-problems,publish,0,0,post,,0,,,,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_oembed_26d382ae88d113c8209ced2e7ac03eb1,{{unknown}},_oembed_aec027e2335781ac926940a31a5f260c,{{unknown}},_oembed_490b28a12a9d10a4bb267a929eddfc82,{{unknown}},_oembed_d10f5519a1b6deb452211c8e9401a271,"<blockquote class=""wp-embedded-content"" data-secret=""MvJrcOA9rC""><a href=""https://www.intuitiveeating.org/10-principles-of-intuitive-eating/"">10 Principles of Intuitive Eating</a></blockquote><iframe class=""wp-embedded-content"" sandbox=""allow-scripts"" security=""restricted"" style=""position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);"" src=""https://www.intuitiveeating.org/10-principles-of-intuitive-eating/embed/#?secret=MvJrcOA9rC"" data-secret=""MvJrcOA9rC"" width=""600"" height=""338"" title=""&#8220;10 Principles of Intuitive Eating&#8221; &#8212; Intuitive Eating"" frameborder=""0"" marginwidth=""0"" marginheight=""0"" scrolling=""no""></iframe>",_oembed_time_d10f5519a1b6deb452211c8e9401a271,1564522300,_oembed_4ee3875d4ce7dd02f3e2d50bf8543a1d,{{unknown}},_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,_thumbnail_id,9235,category,nutrition,Nutrition,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,sbg_selected_sidebar,,60,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,shared_counts,,shared_counts_datetime,1595076551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite these claims obviously being outrageous (Rome wasn't built in a day, people), is the larger idea of targeting specific areas of the body possible?&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The research is pretty clear that targeting fat deposits in specific areas of the body is pretty tricky. One study had participants train a single leg on the leg press and keep the other leg completely untrained.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the end, researchers actually found that more fat mass was lost on the upper body, and there was almost no difference between the trained and untrained leg.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The legs are full of some of our largest muscles, so their calorie-burning potential is huge, which could explain why there was some weight lost, just not in the legs specifically.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So what about that classic problem area - the abs? Another study has half of their participants complete 7 abdominal exercises for 2 sets of 10 reps 5 out of the 7 days per week. The other half did nothing but ate a diet with the same amount of calories as the abs group.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the end the group that worked out was able to do a few more crunches than the non-exercising group, but their group saw any difference in their abdominal fat content.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One of the initial studies on spot fat reduction looked at professional tennis players. In the study they examined the fat content in the tennis players dominant arm, which on the outside looks more muscular and “toned” than the non-dominant hand. The research revealed that the fat content between the two arms was actually very similar, therefore proving that spot fat reduction is likely not possible.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Most (if not all) of the research seems to tell a similar story. Training a specific area to try and target the fat content of that area won’t actually work to reduce fat in that area. What you will see is an endurance adaptation, where that area that you have worked more than other areas will be stronger and more resilient to repetitive exercise. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9260,""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9260""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Spot reduction may not be possible to help deal with stubborn fat in problem areas, but what about targeting specific areas of the body to plump them up, and add more definition?&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There is good news here.

Their body shape is a good indication of where they have been focusing their training.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So although you may not be able to spot reduce fat on your body, once you have reached a happy and healthy overall body fat percentage, you can target specific muscle groups to create greater definition and highlight the areas of the body you love.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><em>Resources used for this article:</em><br><br><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/targeted-weight-loss"">https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/targeted-weight-loss </a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://greatist.com/move/truth-about-spot-toning#3"">https://greatist.com/move/truth-about-spot-toning#3</a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5157064/"">Mechanisms of resistance exercise‐induced muscle hypertrophy: ‘You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs’</a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4562558/"">The effect of training volume and intensity on improvements in muscular strength and size in resistance-trained men</a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9258,2019-08-05 21:31:48,2019-08-06 01:31:48,closed,open,is-spot-reduction-really-possible,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,_thumbnail_id,9259,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595240125,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Being that humans are the product of a very slow evolution, there is an area of nutrition science that believes that we should be eating the way our ancestors did in order to fuel our bodies best.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>But have we evolved past this idea? Are we now consuming so much of the “new food” that it doesn’t matter whether or not that food is similar to what our ancestors could have eaten? This week we will look at the research to find out if eating the way our ancestors did is the key to optimal health.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you think about it, food science has only been around and influencing our food choices for maybe the last century or so. Before that we ate what we could find in nature, or break down and cook using simple tools and fire. Even then, these tools were only developed within the last few thousand years.&nbsp;It is believed that our human ancestors evolved over 4-5 million years ago, but the humans we would recognize (<em>homo erectus, </em>and neanderthals) have been around for around for the last million or so years. Our species, <em>homo sapiens</em> has only come about in the last couple hundred thousand years, and the organized and advanced civilizations have only existed in the last couple thousand years.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9274} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2-1.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9274""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Compare millions of years to a few thousand years of using tools and science and you’ll find that our genes have spent way more time thriving on natural sources, than they have using protein bars and margarine as a fuel source.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So what exactly did the <em>paleolithic</em><em>diet</em> consist of?&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It is believed that our ancestors consumed game meat, which was very lean meat (on time to build up fat stores like our sedentary farm animals). This provided them with good sources of protein, which scientists believe we ate in quantities of up to 2.5 - 3.5g per kg of body mass. This quantity is much higher than the current standard recommendation, which is 0.8 - 1.8g/kg of body mass.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Our ancestors would have also gotten their fats from animals and fatty-foods like nuts and seeds. Separated fats, like olive oil and butter were not available to them because separated fats do not exist naturally; they require some processing to extract.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Finally, carbohydrates were in the form of natural fruits and vegetables. This means that however you found them in nature is how they were consumed. This is why it is believed that grains are a newer source of carbohydrate because these required some processing to make them edible.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>These wild fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins and minerals, and were high in fiber without being high in phytate (a chemical found only in grain sources of fiber).</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As for sweeteners, honey is believed to be one of the only sources of sweetener and when available made up to about 20% of their daily caloric intake.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This is all well and good for our ancestors, but the question remains: If we eat like our ancestors, will we be healthier?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Studies are suggesting it could be useful for improving the health parameters of a few different populations. One study that looked at individuals with at least one of the risk factors for metabolic syndrome (blood pressure, blood cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, triglycerides, and waist circumference) found that by following a paleolithic style diet the numbers associated with these risk factors improved, in comparison to other diets.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Several other studies have looked at the effect of the paleolithic diet on type 2 diabetes. What they’ve found is the paleolithic diet in comparison to other diets is great at lowering risk factors for cardiovascular disease, like blood pressure and bad cholesterol, but it’s effectiveness of fully restoring insulin sensitivity is mixed.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For one of the major threats to our health, cancer, the paleolithic diet could be beneficial due to its no-processed foods structure. Although carbohydrates, which break down into glucose, has been shown to increase the risk of cancer, and feed existing tumours, the other nutrients and high fiber content of the fruits and vegetables in the paleolithic diet could be more protective than harmful. There isn’t much research into the paleolithic diet and cancer, but the few papers that have been written seem to optimistic.It is starting to look like eating like our ancestors may not be such a bad idea. After last week’s blog on “Un-dieting” it is important to know that this blog (like all of our nutrition and diet blogs) are not trying to tell you how you <em>should</em> eat. What we do hope our readers take from this blog is that by making more natural, less-processed food choices, your body will not have to work as hard to work the way it wants to. This will likely manifest itself in more stable energy, better focus throughout the day, healthier body composition, and (hopefully) longevity.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong><em>Resources cited in this article:</em></strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16441938""> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16441938 </a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/1600389.pdf"">https://www.nature.com/articles/1600389.pdf </a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4588744/""> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4588744/ </a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2787021/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2787021/ </a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3267662/""> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3267662/ </a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1520-6505(2000)9:4%3C153::AID-EVAN4%3E3.0.CO;2-D""> https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1520-6505(2000)9:4%3C153::AID-EVAN4%3E3.0.CO;2-D </a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9272,2019-08-11 16:13:05,2019-08-11 20:13:05,closed,open,should-we-go-back-to-ancestral-eating-behaviours-to-move-forward-with-our-health,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9273,_oembed_4f12467cf5af39fb736e36865c1f180f,{{unknown}},_oembed_1e8b8a35750bc22c7ae7d999d924617e,{{unknown}},_oembed_f6d1e8e01ebfcf1157b8061b166e5f61,{{unknown}},_oembed_bd4b62e19c40c8fb0de2c8c417dab59b,{{unknown}},_oembed_2607a42101cdbc30144a6732a2cdee85,{{unknown}},_oembed_82c0031aa91f36101b198407f6f5a48f,{{unknown}},_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,,,,,,,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,,,,,,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,32,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,shared_counts,,shared_counts_datetime,1594945039,shared_counts_total,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many times a new diet emerges and takes the health and fitness industry by storm, the diet fades or is replaced by the next best thing.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Now that the diet has been popular for a few months, it is time to check in and see if the research has found anything that supports the long-term adherence to this type of diet.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>To refresh your memories, the ketogenic diet, or <a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/ketogenic-diet/"">keto diet</a>, is a diet that was designed in the early 1900’s to treat epilepsy. Instead of making glucose the main source of energy for the brain, scientists figured that ketones were a better and safer source of energy for individuals with this condition.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Fast forward to our diet-obsessed culture, and the keto diet became the latest and greatest way to lose weight quickly.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The diet consists of about 70% of your calories coming from fats, 20%-25% from proteins, and 5%-10% coming from carbohydrates in the form of dark leafy greens.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9287} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/1-2.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9287""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Followers of the diet claimed they lost weight quickly, had better energy that lasted longer and didn’t end with a crash, and they ate less frequently because they were able to stay full longer.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Some of the downsides of the diet included the “keto-flu” which occurs at the beginning of the diet and presents as flu-like symptoms while your body transitions from using carbohydrates for energy to ketones for energy. The diet is also extremely low carb, so people really felt like they missed out on life’s simple pleasures like cakes, bread, and sweets.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Now that we remember what the keto diet was all about, let’s see if the research supports long-term adherence to the diet.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One study published in the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2716748/"">Journal of Experimental and Clinical Cardiology</a> took around 80 obese patients and put them on a ketogenic diet. The participants followed the diet for 24 weeks, and the researchers recorded results at 8, 16, and 24 weeks.

Science tells us that putting on size and muscle mass requires carbohydrates. This is certainly true, but keto dieters will have you believe that you can be keto bodybuilder, you just have to do it correctly.

When people follow a keto diet they lose the weight very quickly, but it is a tricky diet to stick to long-term. A cheat meal here and there can mean that the body will desperately want to bounce back to its original set point because it hasn’t spent enough time at the new weight.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So how do you come off of the keto diet without putting the weight back on?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Your best bet is to have a plan.

It is likely this ingredient that has made energy drinks an increasingly popular supplement amongst athletes and young people.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>But energy drinks do not only contain caffeine. In fact some energy drinks can contain upwards of 25 ingredients. The combination of these ingredients with caffeine raises concerns for many consumers and begs the question: are energy drinks bad for us?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are a few concerns with energy drinks. For starters they are typically high in sugar and high in caffeine. This high-energy combo can be really hard on the heart, and if an individual is already living with a weak or compromised cardiovascular system, then energy drinks can be dangerous.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The other issue with energy drinks and their high sugar content is that it makes them very attractive to young people. Potentially people who are far too young to be consuming so much caffeine. The fizzy, sweet, taste makes them seem like a supercharged soda, but kids are getting closer to 3-4x as much caffeine in one energy drink, compared to what they would get in a regular soda.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9305} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2-3.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9305""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Energy drinks have also been observed to disrupt gut bacteria, which could cause harm to other systems in the body (as we know that gut bacteria are a major component to critical functions like the immune system!).

Vitamins are micronutrients that we can get from whole foods. They can also be extracted, or created synthetically. This is the typical form that we find them in in energy drinks. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Energy drinks will also sometimes have ingredients like taurine, which is an amino acid. We get amino acids from protein sources and taurine is an amino acid that we can safely consume.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As more research has come out about the potentially harmful effects of consuming sugar, especially in drinks, energy drink companies have come out with “sugar-free” versions that will typically use a sugar alcohol that is 0-calorie.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Which leaves us with caffeine.

93,Fat Burners Do Not Work. Here's Why,https://freeformfitness.ca/fat-burners-do-not-work-heres-why/,"Mon, 02 Sep 2019 12:44:20 +0000",Ashley,false,https://www.freeformfitness.ca/?p=9312,"<!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Author: Riley Pearce</strong><br><strong>Social Media Director</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9313} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9313""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There is one supplement that is a bit risky to speak about as personal trainers, but to make it perfectly clear why you don’t need fat burners, we’ve decided to bring it up. These supplements claim to increase your metabolism, block fat production, and all kinds of other crazy claims that make us believe that they will get us shredded - just by taking a simple pill.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The reality is, these supplements can actually be potentially dangerous. They are not regulated and therefore companies can put whatever they please in there, make outrageous claims, and sell it to you for a ridiculous price.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The unfortunate thing is that the companies that offer these supplements know full-well that everyone gets to a point in their fitness journey where they just want the quick fix. So they see something labelled as fat burner and think that this will be the magic pill that melts away those last few pounds, and you can finally take a break from eating well and exercising regularly.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Sorry to say, but there are more negative side effects of fat burners, and not enough evidence of them actually helping people lose weight that we are back to square one in terms of finding the “magic pill” for weight loss.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Fat burner claims are nothing without their ingredients. Each ingredient is masterfully selected to create a super combination of fat burning ingredients. To give you an idea of the types of ingredients and their efficacy, we will be looking at a fat burner supplement from one of the top companies. We will leave them nameless to avoid any issues, but if you go into a supplement store, this is likely one of the first fat burners you will see.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Green Coffee Blend (Green Coffee Extract): </strong>Research on overweight and obese individuals consuming green coffee bean extract show weak to limited results for weight loss. Taking it can be beneficial to your health, but not in terms of losing weight.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Caffeine Anhydrous (Caffeine): </strong>This is the form of caffeine without water, and is likely used in this supplement to enable better mixing with the other ingredients. Research also shows weak evidence for caffeine’s ability to increase fat oxidation, but some studies do support that. Fat oxidation is the breaking down of fats and using them for energy.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Many fat burners will claim that they improve mental focus, and this is something that caffeine has been reported to do so it inhibits our fatigue centers of the brain and keeps us awake.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Coleus Extract: </strong>More commonly used in ayurvedic medicine, this is an extract from the herb <em>Coleus Forskohlii</em>. There is not enough research on this herb to confirm any of the claims associated with it. The little research that has been one also reports that there is very weak evidence supporting its ability to promote weight loss.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Blue Skullcap Extract: </strong>Or <em>Scutelleria Lateriflora</em>, is an herb commonly used in chinese medicine and is reported to have nootropic effects. This could also contribute to the super focus that fat burners claim to cause.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Yohimbe Extract: </strong>This is a fat burning compound that sees its best effects during a fasted state. It will inhibit fat production, but that inhibiting process is inhibited by consuming food (most of these supplements advise you to take it shortly before/after eating). It is also linked with anxiety and could interact dangerously with other pharmaceuticals.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Ophiopogon Extract:</strong> This is another compound that is typically found in chinese medicine to apparently help with the flow of bodily fluids. In the case of fat burners it may be included to help with the blood flow as the heart begins to beat faster.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Guayusa: </strong>Last on the list is this strange ingredient that is actually just another form of caffeine. Commonly brewed in the amazon as a tea, it has less caffeine than a regular coffee but more than a cup of green tea.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So maybe the logic is that if you combine all of these weak weight loss compounds and herbs that you will get a strong weight loss supplement?&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>What you end up getting is a potentially dangerous supplement that really isn’t recommended for anyone. With so many forms of caffeine in one supplement the risk for stressing out the cardiovascular system is much higher.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One of the side effects of high doses of caffeine include anxiety and panic attacks. You also cannot be sure that the source of all of these herbs is legitimate, and therefore safe for consumption.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Your best bet if you want to lose weight is to make a plan, find the resources you need to help you lose weight (diet books, personal trainer, supportive friend group, apps), and really commit. Spending your money on an overpriced supplement that basically mashes together a handful of potentially thermogenic compounds is simply not a good investment. Add in the fact that it could create heart problems and anxiety, and it becomes perfectly clear that fat burners do not work.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><em>Resources</em></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30401639""><em>Risks Associated with Fat Burners: A toxicological perspective</em></a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00908.x""><em>Fat Burners: Nutrition Supplements that increase fat metabolism</em></a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""http://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/herbs-botanicals/guayusa-more-caffeine""><em>Nutritional Outlook: Guayusa</em></a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://examine.com/supplements/coleus-forskohlii/""><em>Examine.com</em></a><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9312,2019-09-02 08:44:20,2019-09-02 12:44:20,closed,open,fat-burners-do-not-work-heres-why,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,nutrition,Nutrition,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9313,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,32,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595203943,30,shared_counts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It could be the rise in popularity of <a href=""https://ifbb.com/"">bodybuilding competitions</a>, or maybe it’s the conclusion people come to when they see endurance athletes looking slim, and strength athletes looking more muscley. Either way we would like to debunk this myth once and for all.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It is true that one of the many adaptations that occurs as a result of lifting weights is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_hypertrophy"">hypertrophy</a> - or the increase in the size of our muscle cells. However, one workout of bicep curls will not give you Popeye biceps. In fact, the process of gaining significant muscle mass is incredibly specific and the timeline is different for everyone.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you ask any of the personal trainers at Free Form Fitness, especially the boys (although women can have the goal to put on more muscle), they will all be quick to tell you how difficult it is to put on size.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This is partially due to the fact that muscles are an incredibly “<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8030593"">expensive” tissue</a> - metabolically speaking. It takes a lot of energy and resources to keep muscles working. So the body will actually adapt in favour of decreasing muscle size in order to conserve energy. This is why just a few weeks away from the gym can make you feel like you’ve lost strength.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>From this fact we actually get one of the many benefits of lifting heavy, and that’s that the more muscle mass you have the more potential calories you’ll be burning at rest, and in theory you can eat more because your body needs more calories to maintain that muscle.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So no, doing a couple of workouts with heavy weights <strong>will not</strong> make you bulky.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Lifting heavy weights will provide you with numerous health benefits though. For women, doing challenging load bearing exercise is a great way to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9927006"">keep your bones healthy</a>. As women age, their body begins to leach calcium from the bones because they are unable to absorb vitamins and minerals from food as efficiently. This leaching of calcium can eventually lead to <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968"">osteoporosis</a> and is a serious concern for aging women.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Lifting heavy weights also keeps the connection between the brain and muscles very clear. This super highway that you can build between the brain and the muscles not only benefits the health and strength of the muscle cells, but it can change the health and “strength” of the brain. Weightlifting has <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/well/move/how-weight-training-changes-the-brain.html"">been observed</a> to improve multiple areas in the brain, most notably the memory centers.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Not only is it good for our muscles, our bones, and our brain, but weightlifting is great for our <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15831061"">hormones,</a> those lovely little compounds that are constantly fluctuating in our bodies making us tired, or hungry, or happy, or sad.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>That’s right - by lifting weights your body will release more human growth hormone to help repair the broken down tissue from the exercise. Not only does it repair broken down muscle tissue, but it will also promote the use of fats for energy to help rebuild the muscles. Lifting weights is also a great way to regulate our sex hormones. We have written about the amazing ways testosterone and estrogen affect our bodies, so having these is in a better balance is a great way to ensure we do not suffer from any of the side effects of high estrogen or low testosterone.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Last, but certainly not least, lifting weights is a great way to give the body shape. By having some muscular definition (doesn’t have to be huge and veiny - just some definition) we have something more solid sitting on our skeleton, instead of the soft and somewhat shapeless form we can get when we are not using our bodies to their best abilities.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>To conclude: no, you will not get bulky from lifting heavy weights. Athletes who “get bulky” work incredibly hard to look that way - sometimes taking years of training and specific diets to get there. If they don’t take the time, then there is a good chance that they are using steroids to speed the process along.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Do not be afraid of lifting weights. The benefits far outweigh the very low chance of you getting bulky.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9323,2019-09-08 16:55:04,2019-09-08 20:55:04,closed,open,will-you-really-get-bulky-if-you-lift-heavy,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9324,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595061067,60,shared_counts_total,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is some complicated science that explains how this TNF-ɑ is regulated and therefore expressed in the body, but what you need to know is that curcumin has been found to inhibit the expression of this.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For those of us who live an active lifestyle and push our bodies to the limits, curcumin can be an excellent addition to our healthy<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4074833/""> lifestyle.</a> It has been observed to reduce post-exercise inflammation, and therefore help manage post-exercise soreness. This means that we can recover much faster from our workouts, and be ready to go for another workout much faster than we may have been without the curcumin.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One of the issues with curcumin is its bioavailability. If you want the full benefits of this anti-inflammatory powerhouse then you will have to take it with something to increase its bioavailability.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>You don’t have to go too far to find the perfect pairing for your curcumin though because <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piperine""><em>peperine</em></a>, which can be found in standard black pepper, increases the bioavailability of curcumin by 2000%!</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Curcumin can be bought in supplement form if you aren’t a fan of the taste of turmeric, but of course, consuming turmeric either in powder form, or straight from the turmeric root is also a great option.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If inflammation is something you recognize could be a risk to your health, then try adding a little turmeric into your life and see how it helps.

It’s time to find out if any of these rumours are true and if you should ditch the dairy.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Humans have been drinking milk for 6,000 - 8,000 years and it is the drinking of cow’s milk that led to the domestication of cows.

So why do we continue to drink milk?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Drinking milk is so deeply rooted in the food industry now that it is pretty difficult to go a day without some kind of dairy product. Be it cheese, or butter, or ice cream, or just good old fashioned milk in cereal, tea, or coffee - the stuff is everywhere!&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Because of the many forms milk can take, and the number of people consuming those on a regular basis, dairy farmers and food companies needed to find a way to mass produce it at a low cost and in an efficient manner.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Whether we like it or not, in order for a mammal to produce milk it needs to be feeding its offspring. This means that the cows that dairy farmers own need to have calves often in order to keep up with the human milk demand.

Many studies have shown that working a major muscle group for 10 - 20+ sets per week is a great way to promote muscle gains - or hypertrophy. There is one protocol, proposed by coach <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Poliquin"">Charles Poliquin</a>, that takes this theory to an extreme level.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The protocol is known as <a href=""https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/german-volume-training-programs.html"">german volume training</a>, or GVT, and was developed to mirror the effort and volume observed in german training programs. The idea behind the protocol is to drive up the volume for specific muscle groups in order to supercharge your hypertrophy training sessions.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So how is it done?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Basic GVT (there is an advanced version) is a training program that has you doing 10 sets of 10 reps at 60% of your predicted 1 rep max. Some GVT programs will also have you do a set of antagonist muscle movement between sets of the main movement. This means that if you were doing chest, and therefore a dumbbell chest press for 10 x 10, between each set you would do a movement for back, like a reverse fly, or some kind of row.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This type of protocol seems like it has the right idea. If you kick the crap out of your muscles, you’ll promote major time under tension, major muscle breakdown, and should therefore give you the results you wanted.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For a long time after Charles Poliquin first proposed this style of training it became a bodybuilders holy grail. It feeds right into the intense personality that many elite athletes possess to push themselves to their absolute limit.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>New research is coming out though that may challenge GVT’s effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5969184/#sec4-sports-06-00007title"">study published in 2018</a>, they discovered that in the last 6 weeks of a 12 week GVT protocol that participants actually saw a slight decrease in lean muscle mass in their lower body. Between the 10 set protocol, and the 5 set protocol that it was being compared to, there were very little differences between the progress made between each group.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>What this tells us is that if putting on size is the goal, GVT may not be the holy grail workout plan we once thought it to be. You’d be better off saving some time, increasing your intensity (% of 1 rep max), and cutting your sets in half.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are a few other shortcomings of this program. Doing 10 sets of a single exercise can be <em>very </em>boring, and will quickly make this program one that you do not look forward to.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We all know that your diet during any training program can make or break that program. GVT is no exception to this. Most professionals and experienced GVT coaches would recommend a minimum addition of 500 kcals per day! For some of the more advanced powerlifters they are probably already eating upwards of 3500 - 4500 calories. So to add an additional 500kcals can be tricky.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Last, but certainly not least, this program is really reserved for experienced lifters. It is not that accessible to new trainees because at the beginning of your lifting career doing too much can be hard on the body, and could inhibit progress.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So should you saddling up for a 10 by 10 day of squats at your next gym session? You’re probably better off keeping your sets in the 4 - 6 set range and pushing for greater intensity if you want to put on muscle mass.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9370,2019-09-29 16:21:22,2019-09-29 20:21:22,closed,open,german-volume-training,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9371,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1594852692,30,shared_counts_total,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Or maybe you feel like its getting harder to resist temptation, or you’re eating richer, sweeter, fattier foods more often.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you recognize that these behaviours are not moving you closer to your goals, then give yourself a pat on the back for that, and then take a breath and remind yourself that it’s not just “a funk”.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This time of year is a major time for change. We are heading into the holiday season, with Thanksgiving just around the corner. The days are starting to feel cooler, the leaves are changing, and hours of sunlight are getting shorter.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>These changes, both natural and societal (holiday season), do not go unnoticed by the body. In a <a href=""https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/253953"">2015 stress survey</a> from Healthline, they found that only 10% of respondents felt no stress during the holiday season. Whether it is the financial aspect, hosting guests (both wanted and unwanted), or simply the loss that people are reminded of during this time of year, our bodies are running on StressOS. This will make us more inclined to indulge in sweet and savoury food. We will feel more tired because StressOS takes up a lot of energy, leading to fewer hours in the gym and more time on the couch. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This is why learning appropriate stress management techniques is crucial to year-round consistency with our training. Remember: physical activity is a great way to lower stress levels so put that at the top of your “How to De-Stress” list.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As far as the natural world, that one is a bit more difficult to manage. Our hormones that control our appetite and our sleep cycles are directed by the sunlight we are exposed to. As the sun rises a little later and sets a little earlier every day our ancient brain responds accordingly. This makes waking up a little more challenging and can make us feel tired much earlier in the day.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If the majority of us weren’t working a typical 9-5 job, then this would be no problem. We could sleep and eat according to the winter schedule, and life wouldn’t seem so tiring.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Unfortunately that’s not the case for the 21st century human. So thankfully we have modern science and inventions like the Happy Light, and vitamin D supplements.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>A happy light can mimic the light we get from the sun and therefore trick the brain into thinking we are getting more sun that we actually are. Studies have found that within a week of people using these happy lights for 2 hours a day, their stress and symptoms of depression decreased drastically.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Vitamin D supplementation is also crucial for us northerners. If you can’t take a sunny holiday every few weeks throughout the winter months and get your vitamin D naturally, then you can supplement instead. You’ll want to take your vitamin D supplement with a food source high in fats as it is a fat-soluble vitamin. You’ll also want to aim for about 1000 - 4000 IU per day.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Vitamin D is an essential vitamin that acts as a cofactor in many of the bodies regulatory functions. So if you are running low on vitamin D, then you can risk feeling tired, moody, and weak.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Lastly, the weather is definitely going to affect your drive to get to the gym, or even simply get out of bed. Many people also start to drink less water in the fall and winter, and more warm, caffeinated beverages instead. Dehydration can cause you to feel lethargic, moody, and can cause cravings and brain fog. So continue to make drinking water a priority. You can still have your hot cup of coffee for those cool walks through the crunchy, colourful leaves, but just be sure that when you’re inside and warm that you have 2-3L of water everyday.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you are feeling low on motivation, don’t be too hard on yourself. Simply recognize why you could be feeling more snack-y, or why your energy is low. <br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9381,2019-10-06 13:03:08,2019-10-06 17:03:08,closed,open,why-do-you-feel-so-unmotivated-right-now,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9382,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1594942474,60,shared_counts_total,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All you have to do is get a tattoo.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Yep, that’s right, a tattoo.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Turns out the more you have the better as every additional tattoo has the potential to strengthen the immune system and make it less likely that you will catch the common cold.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This interesting<a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajhb.22847""> study </a>from the University of Alabama used the adaptations the body makes after repeated exercise as its model for adaptation and improvement. The idea is that after you exercise, although the first time is difficult, the body begins to adapt after regular exercise and gets stronger because of it. The body physically becomes more resilient to fatigue and soreness the more you exercise.<br>The researchers looked at 29 individuals before and after their tattoos. Saliva samples of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A"">Immunoglobulin A</a> and <a href=""https://www.yourhormones.info/hormones/cortisol/"">cortisol</a> were taken at both times. Immunoglobulin A is an important protein that acts as a first line of defense against common infections and viruses like the common cold.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>They observed that directly after the tattoo, the immunoglobulin A was slightly lowered because of the stress of the tattoo as it was sent to fight off infection at the site of the tattoo.&nbsp;<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Similarly to how our bodies are higher in cortisol directly after exercise and are weaker post-exercise due to the use of resources for energy and muscle contractions, after tattoos our bodies have higher levels of cortisol and lower levels of useful resources.&nbsp;<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Then the body adapts. When we exercise our body adapts post-exercise so that we are ready with ample resources and strength to complete the next workout. For the tattoo study, they believe that this lowering of Immunoglobulin A directly after the tattoo will force the body to adapt by producing more immunoglobulin A as a response to that stress.&nbsp;<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The more immunoglobulin A we have, the better we are at fighting off colds. Get it?<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Although this study is certainly quirky, it presents a good point. Challenging the body on a regular basis can make us stronger in so many ways. Pushing through a painful tattoo may seem unreasonable at times, but when you push through, you gain some (potentially) very cool body art, and a stronger immune system.&nbsp;<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If tattooing isn’t for you, there are many other ways to keep the immune system strong, and you out of the doctor’s office. Avoiding smoking is a great way to keep the body working in tip-top shape. As we’ve mentioned before, exercise is an excellent activity that helps the whole body and it’s many integrated systems work well. Ensuring your diet includes fruits and vegetables so you are getting a full profile of vitamins and minerals can help support a healthy immune system. Last, but certainly not least, make sure you are getting enough rest and are managing stress. Lack of sleep doesn’t allow the body to recover, heal, or get stronger. Similarly, if you are constantly stressed and are not taking any steps to manage that stress, then your body will be too busy responding to that, to be able to adequately respond to incoming viruses and infections.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9397,2019-10-13 11:45:59,2019-10-13 15:45:59,closed,open,having-this-could-protect-you-from-the-common-cold,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9398,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595281599,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We subconsciously believe that foods that are labelled as organic, local, natural, high protein, low fat, no added sugar, healthy, etc. - are the healthy choice for us.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The issue with the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5986535/"">health halo</a> is that once we have purchased it, we don’t show the same moderation with these products as we would be the normal version of them.

This low-calorie frozen dessert, which prints its total calories onto the front of the container, is a hit amongst health and fitness “gurus”.

The regulation on these types of health claims can be very weak, meaning that companies can make a claim without anyone fact-checking them.

We’ve spoken before about what happened when we took the fat out of food in the late 20th century. Take the fat out, you take away the natural flavour. How do we replace that natural flavour? With processed and refined sugars.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Keep this in mind when you go to buy your next <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28853950"">high protein</a> product item.

If you look at a product like a cliff bar. Yes, they may have up to 20g of protein in them, but how do they taste so good? Turn the cliff bar around and you find out it has 22g of sugar per bar.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For reference - the daily intake suggestion of sugar for women is 25g (6 teaspoons), and for men is 37.5g (9 teaspoons).&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Clever packaging and health buzzwords are all there to serve the purpose of convincing us that whatever is inside that bag or box is good for us. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Although it is shocking how many of these products exist on grocery store shelves, it does not mean that it is impossible to make good choices at the grocery store. If you think something looks too good to be true, chances are it is (organic gummy bears are still gummy bears).&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>To be a smart consumer you should take the next step and turn the box/bag/package around. Look at the nutrition facts and the ingredient list. If it claims to be high protein, but there’s more sugar than protein, it’s a candy bar. If one of the first 5 ingredients is some form of sugar (ends in -ose, or -tol) then there’s probably more sugar in there than you were bargaining for. You’ll also want to keep an eye out for sneaky trans fats, like vegetable oils, canola oil, or safflower oil, to name a few.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Health claims and labels can certainly point us in the direction of healthier items, but just be diligent about ensuring what claims to be healthy truly fits your parameters for healthy.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9417,2019-10-21 18:00:54,2019-10-21 22:00:54,closed,open,what-is-the-health-halo-and-has-it-fooled-you,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9418,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595008650,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some diet plans take you from north american average of about 2000kcals/day to just 600kcals/day. Logging into a popular food tracking app almost always tells you you need to eat just 1200kcals/day to lose weight.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Although short-term calorie restriction has likely worked for many of you in the past, this also comes with a host of psychological struggles, like feeling hangry, or in some extreme cases <a href=""https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/other/orthorexia"">orthorexia</a> and <a href=""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/body-dysmorphia/"">body dysmorphia</a>. This short term cut-back in calories cause also mean that once your calories return to a “normal” level, that much of the weight comes back, with most of us gaining back more than we lost.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>But what if we could stick it out? What if we actually restricted our calories, focused on those calories coming from quality sources, and maintained that restricted calorie diet for many, many years?&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This is actually one of the best ideas that doctors and researchers <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3014770/"">studying</a> aging have to slow down physiological aging.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>They first observed species like yeast and mice living longer and healthier lives when put on a calorie restrictive diet that focused on quality calories.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Then there was the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere_2"">Biosphere 2 project</a>, which had a couple of scientists live in an enclosed environment that was supposed to mimic various ecosystems present on earth. Due to early agricultural issues, the 2500kcal/day diet that they had predicted for the participants, was cut down to 750kcals/day. What they observed was greater insulin sensitivity, healthier body composition, and improvements to metabolic functioning.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It is important to note that in all of the studies where calorie restriction was found to be beneficial, the calories were restricted anywhere from 15% - 35%, and the calories that the participants were consuming came from nutrient dense foods like healthy, natural fats, clean animal protein, and fibrous fruits and vegetables (ie. a balanced diet).</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So if calorie restriction is the key to a longer and healthier life, why is it so hard?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Living in the developed world we are fortunate to have access to stores like Costco and Walmart, where abundance is the selling point of these business. There’s so much <em>stuff</em> for us to consume, and that abundance and availability is what makes it difficult to truly calorie restrict for a long time.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p> Does this make it impossible? Absolutely not. It just means that if you want to take advantage of the fountain-of-youth-esque powers of long-term calorie restriction, you’ll have to be meticulous and you’ll have to be thoughtful. First evaluating how many calories you are consuming now, on average, then figuring out what a 15% restriction of those calories would look like. Once you’ve got that sorted, what foods will give you the most nutrient density for the least amount of calories, or what foods provide not only nutrient density, but also increased satiety, therefore resulting in less hunger and fewer meals?&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For the final piece, it will likely help with the psychological aspect of calorie restriction if you can see this process as something that is good for long term health, rather than a weight-loss diet. As soon as something become a weight-loss diet, you chances of being successful decrease significantly. <br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9462,2019-11-03 12:42:08,2019-11-03 17:42:08,closed,open,this-is-how-long-term-calorie-restriction-affects-the-body,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9463,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595257113,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We need a myriad of vitamins and naturally occurring minerals to help keep our various types of cells working correctly, to allow our brain to communicate with our tissues, and to help maintain hormone balance throughout the body.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As nutrition science continues to progress, we continue to discover the importance of different vitamins and minerals. It was just in the last 60 years that we discovered this article’s featured mineral: Zinc.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the 1960’s an Iranian farmer who's diet consisted of flat bread, potatoes, and milk, was found to have underdeveloped reproductive organs, <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351360"">anemia</a>, and <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dwarfism/symptoms-causes/syc-20371969"">dwarfism</a>. The cause: zinc deficiency. Later, scientists also discovered children in Ethiopia with similar diets who were suffering from the same consequences of zinc deficiency.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3724376/"">Zinc</a>, as it turns out, is an incredibly important micronutrient in the human diet. Due to it’s relatively recent discovery, it’s exact interactions with various systems and tissues is still not quite well-known, but we do know that it plays a role in the development of many of our organ systems and the maintenance of <a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/science/high-school-biology/hs-human-body-systems/hs-body-structure-and-homeostasis/a/homeostasis"">homeostasis</a>. It is especially critical in the diet of babies, children, adolescents, and pregnant and breast-feeding women.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Although scientists can’t say exactly how zinc works within the body they can say that without it we can run into a few problems. In the eldery, zinc deficiency can contribute to many of the signs of aging that we are familiar with already. These include increased weakness, psychological deficiencies like loss of memory and cognitive function, and diarrhea. For young and developing individuals, zinc deficiency can impair the overall development of those individuals. It can stunt growth, and cause developmental deficiencies in critical areas like their reproductive system in males (as seen in the Iranian and ethiopian populations discussed above).</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/#h5"">Zinc deficiency</a> can also weaken the immune system, and in severe cases can lead to diarrhea, loss of appetite, hair loss, <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health/erectile-dysfunction/common-causes-impotence"">impotence</a>, and eye and <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/symptom/skin-lesion"">skin lesions</a>.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So although we may not know how exactly zinc works with the body, we sure know how not having enough of it can leave us in rough shape. The current <a href=""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263176.php"">recommendations</a> for zinc intake per day are <strong>8mg for women</strong> and <strong>11mg for men</strong>. If you are any of the special populations mentioned above (pregnant, lactating women, growing children, or elderly) then your intake will have to be higher to support the higher demands of zinc. Also, if you are consuming a plant-based diet you will also require more zinc, or may benefit from zinc supplementation.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The main inhibitor of zinc absorption is <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/phytic-acid-101"">phytic acid</a>, which is a major component in cereal and legumes. This is why vegetarians and those individuals from Iran and Ethiopia that we mentioned before are typically zinc deficient.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So where can we get <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-foods-high-in-zinc#section4"">zinc from naturally</a>? Animal proteins are the top sources for zinc and are where we can get the most bioavailable zinc, meaning it is the easiest for the body to absorb and we will likely absorb more of it from these sources. Just 100g of ground beef contains 44% of our daily required zinc.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The true zinc heavyweights are shellfish. Just 6 oysters provides you with almost 300% of your daily required zinc! Alaskan crab has a whopping 69% of your daily intake, and shrimp and mussels provide a modest 14% for every 100g.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Although cereals and legumes are high in phytic acid and would then intuitively be poor choices for dietary zinc, there is a way around this. Has anyone ever told you to soak your nuts, seeds, and legumes before? This is a critical step in removing the phytic acid from these foods. Once you have soaked and rinsed your cereals and legumes, things like chickpeas, lentils and beans can offer up to 14% of your daily zinc intake. Hemp seeds, pumpkin seeds, squash seeds, and sesame seeds are also great sources of zinc providing up to 43% of your required daily intake.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>When it comes to zinc you really want to make sure you are getting enough of it in your diet in order to develop properly. Thankfully there are a ton of natural sources to help you meet your daily intake requirements!<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9481,2019-11-10 14:05:12,2019-11-10 19:05:12,closed,open,zinc-why-we-need-it-and-where-to-get-it-naturally,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9482,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595052906,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although science has proven that this isn’t always true, it has oversimplified men’s health, and put too much emphasis on the wrong things. Their health magazines are filled with ab workouts, <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/health/19-breakthrough-ways-proven-to-increase-testosterone-naturally/"">weird tips</a> to boost testosterone, and a couple of fancy watch ads.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Men’s health doesn’t deserve such a simple treatment. So here are 4 ways that you can start to take better care of your health or the health of the men in your life.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>1. Take the Time to Figure Out the Fitness Routine that’s Best for You/Them</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We can all be very quick to jump on whatever fitness bandwagon has made the headlines. But we have all been in the situation where we try it out and find that it is actually not enjoyable at all. Not even the promise of more daily physical activity and improved fitness can make you stick with it.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This is why trying a few different options is a great way to make fitness a part of your life. Try everything that’s out there and catches your eye. Along the way you’ll find things you really don’t like, and you’ll find something that you absolutely <strong><em>love</em>!</strong> Having fun is one of the best ways to increase the probability of sticking with something.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>2. Get Educated on</strong><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27289511""><strong> Men’s Nutrition</strong></a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There is way more to men’s nutrition than just chugging protein shakes and eating steaks. In fact men’s nutrition is just as complex and important as women’s nutrition, despite what the magazine articles tell you.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Men, just like women, should be getting their energy/fuel from a variety of sources. These should be whole food sources, with an emphasis on high quality protein, consuming 0.8 - 1.8g of protein for every kilogram of bodyweight.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Men should also be including high fiber, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats in their diet. Men are statistically at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. An easy way to keep your risk of developing CVD is by consuming the type of diet that doesn’t put too much stress on the body and the heart.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>3. Check your alcohol consumption</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Although we are not supporters of gender-based stereotypes, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2844334/"">statistically</a> more men are more likely to be heavy drinkers. Alcohol is deeply woven into social interactions, but the quantity of alcohol consumed can be harmful.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It is well known that <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/mens-health.htm"">alcohol</a> has inflammatory effects on the body. Beer has also been shown to promote visceral adiposity (think <em>beer belly</em>). Although the beer belly has gained popularity in the age of the <em>dad bod</em>, science has also shown us that the ratio of waist circumference to hip circumference is an easy indicator of risk for health complications.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>4. Men Need More Physical Touch</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In an article from the<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/well/family/gender-men-touch.html""> New York Times</a>, they report on a study that shows just how important physical touch is to men. This is not your typical exercise of nutrition fitness tip, but its value to a man’s overall health is critical.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In fact, simple <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30730854"">platonic touch</a> has been shown to help lower stress levels, heart rate, and blood pressure.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Again, as men are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease, the simple act of platonic touch can be a free and easy way to improve their help.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This month (and every month) we should be focusing on helping keep those man-colds away, and having the men in our lives focused on their long-term health. It is so easy to fall into comfortable patterns, and fast-food options. If we can collectively promote a more balanced and supportive approach to men’s health, we can enjoy the company fathers, brothers, grandfathers, friends, and partners for a very long time.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9588,2019-11-17 15:55:00,2019-11-17 20:55:00,closed,open,4-tips-for-men-to-improve-their-health-today,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9589,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595281620,30,shared_counts_total,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Researchers took samples of blood and used other common methods of testing the severity of cancer to determine how advanced and aggressive the participant’s prostate cancer was.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Researchers then provided 8 lifestyle changes that the men should undertake to reduce the risk of their prostate cancer carrying on in its current level of virulence. Based on the men’s adherence to those lifestyle changes, and the number of lifestyle changes they adopted, their risk dropped accordingly.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If men were to only take on 4 of the 8, they’d be at a 38% greater chance of developing a more aggressive tumour. But for every point of adherence to the protocol, the risk of developing a more aggressive tumour dropped by 13%.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So what are the <a href=""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/262675.php"">8 lifestyle changes</a> they proposed and found to be effective?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>First, they recommend that all men aim to be as lean as possible, carrying as little additional body fat as is healthy for their height and weight. With that said, men should not become underweight, so speak with a doctor to determine what a healthy weight and bodyfat percentage are for you or your loved one.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The next recommendation is one that we are very familiar with at Free Form Fitness. The researchers found that men who were physically active for at least <strong>30 minutes a day </strong>reduced their risk of developing more aggressive tumours.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The following recommendation looks at a common villain in the world of diseases - sugar. It should come as no surprise that the researchers recommended that men keep their sugars low, and to especially avoid sugary drinks and energy dense (high calorie, small portion size) foods.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Next up is another dietary recommendation that we’ve seen before: consume a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes. Following this, the researchers recommend that men limit their consumption of processed and red meats. Not to eliminate entirely, as red meats do come packed with important nutrients, but to limit their consumption. These two recommendations are really trying to emphasize the fact that if men want to be as healthy as possible, their diet should consist of a variety of foods, instead of the standard north american “meat and potatoes” diet.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Next on the list - alcohol. If men are going to consume alcohol, researchers suggest that they limit it to 2 drinks per day as alcohol has been shown to have inflammatory effects on the body. Chronic inflammation can only lead to a decrease in health status, so if someone already has a tumour, it makes sense that they would want to avoid pro-inflammatory foods.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Second to last recommends a reduction of salt in the diet, and to avoid foods that are highly processed with salt.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The final recommendation was to avoid supplements that claim to protect against cancer. They emphasize that lifestyle changes are the best way to reduce your risks, and then following doctors recommendations for treatment plans if you or a loved one have already been diagnosed with prostate cancer.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So there you have it! If you or a loved one are at risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis, or have already been diagnosed and want to control the disease, these are the changes you should consider making.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><em>The purpose of this article is not to propose clinical treatment of prostate cancer. The article is simply to report on scientific findings and share the best data to help with audiences own personal research.</em><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9655,2019-11-24 11:29:05,2019-11-24 16:29:05,closed,open,these-lifestyle-changes-could-reduce-the-risk-of-prostate-cancer,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9656,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595281722,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This means that vegans are consuming a variety of fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, and grains and any other product that those ingredients can create.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For the vegan holiday meal prep we are bringing you a recipe from <a href=""https://avirtualvegan.com/brussels-sprout-salad-cranberry-pecan/"">A Virtual Vegan</a> and their <a href=""https://avirtualvegan.com/vegan-christmas-dinner-menu/"">ultimate vegan christmas dinner menu</a>.

They are generally cut quite thickly and having thin slices really makes a difference to flavour and eatability. Pre-chopped veggies also are often a bit dry and withered around the edges. Fresh is best and will pay dividends in flavour, texture and appearance.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This salad will keep well for a couple of days in the fridge once dressed. The sliced sprouts don't go slimy like lettuce does. If you are storing it though I would advise leaving the chopped nuts out until just before you serve to keep them nice and crunchy.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This salad can easily be made nut-free. Just omit the nuts from the dressing. It is still really good without them. And in the salad you can either omit the nuts completely or use some pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Estimated nutrition per serving:</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Serving: 1serving | Calories: 285kcal | Carbohydrates: 47g | Protein: 7g | Fat: 10g | Sodium: 39mg | Fiber: 9g | Sugar: 29g | Vitamin A: 1200IU | Vitamin C: 190.6mg | Calcium: 90mg | Iron: 2.5mg</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Glute-Free Diet: Sweet Potato Casserole with Crunchy Oats</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Eating gluten-free is maybe a diet a few of us have forgotten about, but those with celiac disease and gluten intolerances, gluten-free recipes are all they can stomach during the holiday season.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For our next meal prep item we bring you the s<a href=""https://www.cookinglight.com/recipes/sweet-potato-casserole-crunchy-oat-topping"">weet potato casserole with a crunchy oat topping</a> from Cooking Light.

But it’s okay because you usually only ever get 5 or 6 hours of sleep and you can function on that … right?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are a lot of people, some of you even, who truly believe that they can get through their lives on less than the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep every night. We are here today to show you the evidence that suggests that although you may feel awake and are getting through your daily life, you may not be as awake as you originally thought.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>When humans sleep several important processes occur to help us heal, create memories, process the day’s events, and basically keep things moving along as they should. For the body to recover it needs to cycle through a few sleep phases every night. This is why your trainers will tell you that on top of working out, eating well, and keeping stress low, you need to make sure you’re getting good sleep to make the most of your workouts.There are a few identified sleep disorders that can disrupt these sleep phases, and therefore decrease the efficacy of your sleep. Although there are over 100 different sleep disorders, they can be <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5449130/"">categorized</a> into sleep deprivation (can’t get enough sleep), sleep fragmentation (disrupted sleep, middle insomnia), and events that occur during sleep like sleep apnea and restless leg (yes - that is a real thing!).</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>When these types of disruptions to your sleep occur you can experience a few different consequences. Your <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4377487/"">metabolism</a> can be affected, and your ability to regulate blood glucose levels can be impaired. Your focus can lag throughout the day, and you are more likely to be irritable.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>But for those of you who claim that you are able to function “perfectly well” on just 5-6 hours of sleep, pay close attention: your brain is actually trying to get the rest it needs while you are awake.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>That’s right - parts of your brain are going into episodes of local-sleep in order to allow for all of those necessary sleep functions to occur. This means that although you may be awake, you do not have access to the full functioning capacity of your brain.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Ever felt like sometimes you wake up and start going through the motions of the day? All of a sudden you are at work but you don’t really remember the drive. You work the whole day, staring at your computer screen, and then your office neighbour is saying goodnight and you realize the work day is already over? This kind of mindless progression through the day is likely caused by these local-sleep episodes. Your brain will allow for the very basic functions to occur so you can move, and speak, and get menial tasks done, but you really aren’t at your best.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This <a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/4/110427-sleep-deprived-brains-nature-science-health-rat-asleep-awake/"">research</a> suggests that even our most ambitious friends and colleagues who seem to be superheros on 4 hours of sleep are actually more susceptible to make poor and risky decisions due to their lack of sleep.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If sleep can still occur in a brain that has lesions in the areas that control sleep, then sleep must be an absolutely critical function to our survival.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So go ahead, get nestled and snug in your beds. Appreciate the visions of sugar-plums dancing in your heads. Because sleep is essential and vital to your health, get your 7-9 hours and feel more like yourself.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9684,2019-12-08 14:37:26,2019-12-08 19:37:26,closed,open,can-you-really-get-by-on-less-than-8-hours-of-sleep,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9685,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595281584,30,shared_counts_total,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether it is finding the perfect gift, keeping holiday party schedules organized, or being reminded of those who don’t get to celebrate with us this year, we all have a few <em>bah humbug</em> moments.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>What happens when stress becomes part of our Christmas past, present, and future? How exactly does chronic stress impact our lives beyond the holiday season?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Let’s first look at the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5573220/"">different types</a> of stress we encounter in our daily lives. First we have normal stress. This stress is actually something we need. We experience this when we take on a new task and rise to the challenge of that task. This enables us to grow and learn and isn’t the type of stress we need to worry about.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The second type of stress is tolerable stress. The tolerability of this stress is determined by our own personal perceptions of stress, and also the support systems we have around us to help us deal with the stress. Tolerable stress is also important to our lives as it reminds us of the importance of family, friends, and a strong support system. It also can prove to us that we are more resilient than we may realize.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The final stress is known as toxic stress. This kind of stress is most prevalent in individuals with poor support systems, or early-life events that decreased their self-esteem, their good impulse-control, and their judgement. It is toxic in the way that poison is toxic. Even in small doses it can end up wreaking havoc on multiple organ systems, and causing lasting damage.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>No matter what kind of stress we have in our life, the response from the body is complex. Hormones, the brain, and metabolism all adapt to stress in order to protect the body. It is an ancient system that allowed us to adapt to changing environments, threats, and changes in food supply.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>But in a world where everything seems to change every day, we have more stress than we have ever had to deal with. We also live in a very cushioned world too. If we don’t like the environment outside, we can stay inside. If we don’t like people, or are afraid of a situation, we can just avoid it. This has made that toxic stress more prevalent in more people, and this is where the issue lies.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Toxic stress can throw our body so out of whack, that it creates a diseased state in the body. Our systems simply cannot keep track of all of the threats, so it puts all of our resources behind protecting us from the threat and we deplete the system. This leaves our internal health vulnerable to disease, metabolic syndrome, our risk for infection increases, and many times we try to treat this constantly stressed state with vices like drugs, alcohol, food, and isolation.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The actual neurophysical (brain-body) mechanisms of how chronic stress can really mess with our health is incredibly complex, and out of the scope of our blog, but there are a few main points to be taken from this article.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The first is that stress becomes more manageable with good support systems. This is why our trainers are encouraging of you and your fitness journey, but they also promote having a healthy circle of family, friends, and colleagues who are supportive of you.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The second is that a little stress is actually very good for you. Simple things like starting a new job, giving a presentation, or going on that first date, although stressful, are actually an opportunity to give your body a challenge it can overcome. By facing these types of stresses in life, we grow and become more resilient, which makes more of our stress tolerable or normal stress.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Finally, during the holiday season a lot of the stress we experience is brought on by our own expectations of ourselves. We expect ourselves to be everywhere, do everything, get the best gifts but also not to destroy our budgets.&nbsp;During the holiday season, the best thing you can do for your health is to set healthy expectations of yourself, be with those who support you, and to take moments to appreciate the little things that <em>are good</em> in life.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9701,2019-12-15 15:32:08,2019-12-15 20:32:08,closed,open,why-christmas-stress-can-become-chronic-stress,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9702,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595076958,30,shared_counts_total,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amelie and Jonathon had just gotten home from Jon’s parent’s place after spending the week of Christmas with them.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As Jonathon went into the bedroom to start unpacking his suitcase, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. What was once the reflection of an active, young, business development associate at an up-and-coming tech company, was now the reflection of a tired, grey-ing, Director of BD.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Jon’s ambition was something that he had always prided himself on. He grew up with no siblings and therefore got all the attention of his parents. They too were hard workers and instilled an attitude of “if you want it, work for it” in him from a young age.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>While working to move up in his career his health held a position of lesser importance on his priority list. Jon used to play tennis 2-3 times per week, and even played on a men’s pick-up basketball team on his off nights. As work demanded more of him he saw less of the courts, and more of the insides of planes, hotel rooms, and his office.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>While Jon was unpacking, Amelie had gone into the kitchen to see what they had in the fridge and cupboards. She and Jon would need to get groceries, before the stores close on New Years Day. When she got to the fridge what she found was a number of half-finished take-out containers, some butter, and cream for her’s and Jon’s morning coffee.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It was in this moment that Amelie realized that this is what her life had become. As Jon pursued his career goals, Amelie was also busy working away on her PhD in Biochemistry. Long nights in the lab and juggling her own life of meeting with advisors and working as a student teacher for a couple undergrad and masters seminars, meant that Amelie and Jon’s favourite activity as a couple - cooking - had taken a back seat. They would rush in the mornings to get ready, put their coffee in a travel mug, and be off. At the end of the day they’d both be so tired they’d just order in and promise to cook the next day.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Amelie was also active in her younger years. She played soccer and was an avid runner, having run in a half-marathon, and at least half a dozen 10k’s. Unfortunately she suffered an injury to her right knee and was never able to fully recover. She was incredibly intelligent, and was able to complete her Master’s project a full year before the other students in her program. As her injury took her away from her active hobbies, Amelie turned her focus to her studies and this quickly came to consume all of her time.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As their lives moved forward and the two achieved great success in many aspects of their lives, the couple had forgotten the one thing that matters most in life: Their health.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Jon was now 35lbs heavier than he was when he first started his job, and Amelie had 20lbs sneak its way onto her body.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Amelie closed the fridge and made her way to the bedroom. When she arrived she found Jon sitting on the bed with his head in his hands. Without saying it, the two of them knew what the other was thinking - “What happened?”</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Being that it was the day before New Year’s Eve and the whole world was reflecting on the last year and setting goals for 2019 to make it the best year ever, Jon and Amelie decided the two of them would set goals that would bring their health back into focus.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>They spent the evening discussing what would work best for their schedules, how Jon would manage getting exercise and good meals in when he’s travelling; how Amelie would manage meals and find a way to get active again, while respecting the injury to her knee.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The two of them had a single meeting with a dietician, just to get some professional tips on how to make healthy choices when you are limited for time. Jon then hired himself a personal trainer who could guide him through workouts while he was in town, and provide support through check-ins and modified workouts for hotels via email while he was away.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Due to Amelie’s injuries, she first had to meet his a physiotherapist. She had heard that swimming was a great low-impact sport for joints, so she found the free-swim times at her university’s pool and worked 15-30 minute swims into her schedule. She met with her physiotherapist as many times her student-insurance would cover and then took the exercises and advice into her daily life once the appointments ran out.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>After a year Jon and Amelie found themselves again coming home after spending the week of Christmas with Jon’s parents.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This year, however, Jon and Amelie were coming home to something different.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As Jon walked past the mirror in his bedroom he saw someone who had consistently worked out 3-4 times per week, including the weeks where he was travelling for work. Not every workout was the “best workout”, but he maintained a schedule and kept the effort consistent.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As Amelie looked in the fridge, she found some wilted greens, a leftover casserole, some dark chocolate, along with a few other colourful ingredients. This view of the fridge now reminded her of those times that Jon was home between business trips and they were able to try new recipes together. She was reminded of those exceptionally long days at school and coming home to a home-made prepared meal.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Amelie’s knee, although not perfect, caused her less pain and she was really enjoying her new swimming routine. She had even convinced a few of her colleagues to join her, to make some of those early swimming sessions more social, the way that her running group was.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Amelie and Jon are now looking forward to 2020 with new goals. Jon is hoping he can start to play tennis or basketball again. Amelie is looking at getting herself into a gym with a personal trainer a few times a week to progress the exercises that her physiotherapist had given her. Although the two of them had not lost all of the weight that they had gained over the years, Amelie was down 10lbs and Jon was down 18lbs! The two of them had stopped weighing themselves though, as they loved the way they looked and felt. They had energy again, and actually found it easier to manage the demands of their respective careers.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For these two, all they had to do was sit down and pick the 1 thing that was stopping them from attending to their health. Amelie had an old knee injury that she needed to heal, and Jon needed help to figure out how to be active with his more demanding work schedule.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This story may be fictional but the limitations, the solutions, and the outcomes are all very real. You may be sitting reading this and reflecting on how your life has changed over the years, and thinking about what you could do in the next year to achieve your goals.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Setting goals in the various aspects of your life provides you with direction for the next year. As a society, setting goals gives us purpose, and this is essential to the human experience. Your health and longevity should most certainly be one of those aspects that you create a goal, or goals, for.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Instead of writing yet another article about the science of motivation and goal setting, this story was meant to act as a guideline and example for how easy it is to achieve <strong><em>1 simple goal</em></strong>. In both cases, getting some help and guidance was crucial to their success. It took the guess-work out of the equation, and allowed the two characters to continue on with their busy lives, but now they had some structure to achieve their goals. Whether your health and longevity goal is a diet change, weight loss, muscle building, balance improvement, energy improvement, injury, etc., there is someone out there who is trained to get you from where you are to where you want to be faster than you would be able to on your own.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>2019 was okay, but now we enter a new decade.

110,Is Counting Calories Important?,https://freeformfitness.ca/is-counting-calories-important/,"Mon, 06 Jan 2020 03:44:09 +0000",Ashley,false,https://freeformfitness.ca/?p=9745,"<!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Author: Riley Pearce</strong><br><strong>Director of Social Media</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9746} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image4-1024x614.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9746""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>You have likely heard the phrase “<em>calories in, calories out”</em> as it relates to weight loss/weight gain. It brings the seemingly complicated process of managing weight down to a math equation. If you consume more calories than you burn, then you gain weight. If you consume fewer calories than you burn, then you’ll lose weight. Sounds pretty easy?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>But is it as simple as that?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With apps like Lose It and MyFitnessPal that track your meals based on calories and macronutrients, it is easier than ever to measure your caloric intake. Now that we have wearable tech, we can also get a rough estimation of our caloric output, or the calories we are burning every day. So if we are diligent about inputting our food properly, and we have our tech tracking us accurately, it becomes very easy to do this simple calories in vs. calories out math equations. Again we ask - <em>is it as simple as that?</em></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>What Contributes to Calories Out</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>How we burn fuel, either from food or fat stores in the body, depends on <a href=""https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.00156.2017?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed"">2 things</a>: how much energy we use to simply exist, and how much energy we use to move and exercise.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The first type of energy expenditure is called Resting Energy Expenditure, or REE. This accounts for 60-70% of our daily energy expenditure and is the energy we require to keep our hearts beating, and our brain’s thinking. REE varies greatly from one person to the next as factors like height, weight, and even organ size can contribute to how much energy we require to stay alive. Lean body mass is also critical here. Muscles require more energy to maintain their mass, so the more lean mass on the body, the higher this energy expenditure will be.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The second way we can burn calories is by hitting the gym and breaking a sweat!&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Actually, in reality, all forms of physical activity will burn additional calories, but they will do so in different quantities. For example, pushing a grocery cart around the grocery store will burn calories, but not nearly as many as pushing a weighted prowler down a track of turf at max effort. The same is true of walking vs. running, or walking uphill vs. walking on a flat surface. Each of these count as physical activity because they require more energy than when you are at rest, but different activities will require more energy than others.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Physical activity is also very different from one person to the next. This is due to fitness level. For an athlete who already trains multiple times per week, the type of physical activity that would burn many calories would be very different from a mostly sedentary retiree. For the athlete they’d need something very intense to elicit additional calorie burn, whereas our sedentary retiree could go for a leisurely walk to increase their calorie burn.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9747} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image3.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9747""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There is a third way that we burn calories, called the Thermal Effect of Food, or TEF. It accounts for the slight raise in body temperature that occurs due to the metabolism of certain foods. THis makes up about 10% of total caloric expenditure and depends on the macronutrient profile of the food being consumed. Proteins have the greater thermal effect, while fats have the lowest thermal effect.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Is a Calorie </strong><strong><em>Just </em></strong><strong>A Calorie?</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Some people believe that not all calories are created equally. Some people cite ancestral preferences as a way to predict how certain macronutrients (carbs, fats, proteins) will affect them, some medical conditions change the way the body metabolizes macronutrients, and some people think that they can eat whatever food they want, as long as they reach their calorie goal.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So who is right?<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":9748} --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image2.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-9748""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Let’s look at the almonds vs. the chocolate bar argument. In one 46g Kit Kat bar there are 239 Calories. 46g of almonds yields 266 Calories. If we were to only base decisions on calories, choosing the Kit Kat would be the “smart” choice because it has fewer calories, yet we know that the almonds are the better choice for our bodies.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So no, <a href=""https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/theres-no-sugar-coating-it-all-calories-are-not-created-equal-2016110410602"">not all calories are created equally</a>.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We can see this in recent research that suggests that certain foods can promote inflammation, and even cancer! Too much carbohydrates can exhaust the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas and lead to type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Calories Concluded</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We now know that not all calories are created equally. We do also know that the calories in vs. calories out equation is slightly more complicated than we originally thought.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Keeping all of this in mind, counting calories <em>can</em> actually be a useful tool for those who want to understand their food and their diet better. You may think you are consuming good portion sizes and a healthy balance of nutrients, but when you track them you discover you’re low on important vitamins and minerals and your macronutrients are way out of balance.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Counting calories is a good idea to get a better sense of their calorie consumption, and can help you make the necessary changes to your diet this new year. Should you obsess over whether your calories in is greater than the caloric output you fitness tracker is telling you you’ve burned - definitely not. Simply use it as just another tool to educate yourself on your food and your lifestyle.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9745,2020-01-05 22:44:09,2020-01-06 03:44:09,closed,open,is-counting-calories-important,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9746,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595257071,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chances are you know what you should be doing to achieve your health and fitness goals, but the question is how do you make it stick?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Creating a healthy lifestyle is a great way to make all of those tricky healthy behaviours much easier. Here are just a few ways you can make your desired healthy habits into a long-lasting lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Find a way to play</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Do you ever see kids eating oreos and ice cream one minute, and then running around with friends for hours? Do you ever wonder how those kids manage to stay in “good shape” despite the oreos and ice cream? It is because of play.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As adults we replace play time with fancy social events, and dinner parties. We hang out with friends in a new way, and spend a lot of our time working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you want to make physical activity part of your life, then find a way to play again. You can join walking or running groups, play on a men’s or women’s recreational sports team, or join the local community center for an aquafit class, spinning, or yoga. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you have a fun way to move, physical activity doesn’t feel like work. All sports can be supported by a consistent strength training routine too. Instead of working out because you feel like you have to, you can begin to work out for the purpose of making your sport more enjoyable.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Make food fun</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One of the hardest parts about dieting is feeling like you always have to adjust your eating styles or be “that friend” that can’t go out because of their diet. If you don’t want your new healthy food choices to be reason for fuss, get the family or your friends excited about it.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Host a dinner party where you only cook “fun” foods with healthy ingredients. Bring the kids grocery shopping, and make cooking meals fun. In the end it is just food and we all need to eat. The more people who see your food choices as something to look forward to, the less strain you will feel on your social and family life.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The internet is filled with tasty recipes that can make any boring vegetable or protein into a flavour explosion - and a family favourite.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Spend time with people who are already living a healthy life</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>They say that you are the combination of the 5 people you spend the most time with. If you want to live a healthy lifestyle, an easy way to make that happen is to fill your life with health-minded individuals.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With this one, make sure you choose the people who live your ideal healthy lifestyle. If you have friends who seem healthy but their diets are restrictive, and their workout routine is more intense than you’d ever hope to achieve, then they aren’t the right type of person to model your healthy lifestyle after. But the right people do exist, and who knows, maybe one day you’ll be that person for someone else!</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Commit to What Works For </strong><strong><em>You</em></strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Last, but certainly not least, the best way to make fitness a lifestyle is to make sure everything you do works for <em>you</em>. If you constantly feel like you’re forcing yourself to eat weird diet food, or you actually hate going to spin class, then they’ll never become a part of your lifestyle.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The most important fitness principle is individuality: Every workout program, every “diet”, every way to play will be different for every person because every person is different. If all of your friends are taking up running, but you know you’d prefer to be lifting weights, then go lift weights.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Making fitness a lifestyle doesn’t mean that you need to become an ultramarathoner who only eats chicken, rice, and broccoli. Making fitness a lifestyle means finding little ways that you can incorporate physical activity, whole foods, and a couple glasses of water into the life you are already living. <br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9783,2020-01-12 16:53:13,2020-01-12 21:53:13,closed,open,4-easy-ways-to-make-fitness-a-lifestyle,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9784,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595120557,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The list of considerations goes on and on.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If there is one aspect of exercise that is often overlooked it is technique. How you perform a movement is something that everyone should be thinking about when they approach a new exercise.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Anyone who has attempted a lift like the deadlift without understanding proper technique can attest to this.

A personal trainer has gone through certifications, and education to understand the joints and muscles of the body in order to truly understand the technique involved in performing these moves correctly.

If performed incorrectly, both of these movements have the potential to lead to injury, and you could develop very bad muscle imbalances.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Lastly, these 10 movements are known as compound movements. They require multiple joints, and large muscle group in order to perform the exercises properly. If you can master the technique of these moves, your whole body benefits from each exercise. Not only that, but the energy required to perform these exercises is much higher than that of isolation exercises, and therefore you get a much higher calorie burn from these exercises, than you would have had you isolated the individual muscles used in the compound movements.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Technique matters, and although rushing through a workout and just getting exercises done might feel like you’re getting the most out of your workout, you are missing out on a major part of the workout. So talk to your trainer about proper technique and have fun educating yourself on the value of proper exercise technique.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9813,2020-01-19 11:02:43,2020-01-19 16:02:43,closed,open,get-the-most-out-of-your-workout,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9814,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595118901,30,shared_counts_total,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When this hormone is released in pleasurable situations, it creates a brief feeling of euphoria, calmness, and contentment.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Dopamine is not only released in interpersonal situations. Dopamine is also one of the hormones released when we eat. Back when we were living off of the land, the brain devised a system to reward us for finding food. Back then, food wasn’t just a few steps away in our kitchens or the local corner store, so we needed a little extra push from the brain to keep us fed and alive.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So although the release of dopamine when we eat came from useful beginnings, now it actually creates a bit of a problem for us.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Our desire to experience the rush of dopamine can lead us to crave those things that cause the release of the hormone. This is why snacking throughout the day, sometimes mindlessly, can occur. It is what drives late night snacking, and stress eating. We’re all just looking for the next hit of dopamine.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Going back to the times of living off the land, our hunting and gathering activities were restricted to when the sun was out. This meant that the development of our dopamine response and our circadian rhythm worked together to make sure we were hungry when the sun was out, and then able to sleep when the sun went down.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Returning to modern times, we are working, playing, socializing, surfing the web, and watching netflix at all hours of the day. Snacking before, during, and after all of these activities means that we are releasing dopamine into the body when the sun is up <em>and when it is down</em>.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We may be getting a lot of dopamine in our body, which feels good for a moment, but what we are also doing is disrupting the partnership between dopamine and the circadian rhythm. Our old brain is still operating on the original OS, while we exist in this iPhone 11 Pro world. So when we eat and the brain is then flooded with dopamine, it also throws off our circadian rhythm.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you don’t know what the circadian rhythm is, it is the natural rhythm of various hormones and neutro-transmitters that run on a cycle all day and control some of our most basic functions like dreaming, waking up, hunger, satiation, and falling asleep. When the circadian rhythm is thrown off course, a few things can happen.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In this case with dopamine, it leads to more snacking at irregular times of the day.<strong> This is no longer hunger, this is cravings</strong>. Cravings for dopamine, not sustenance.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>What we are trying to say is that by snacking throughout the day we disrupt our body’s natural ability to regulate hunger and satiety, which means you snack more often. What does snacking lead to? <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3242470/"">Unwanted weight gain</a>.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So if you want to get that euphoric feeling of dopamine but also have weight loss goals, you may want to try other activities such as working out, meditating or having sex.

This whole month you will be able to find events and fundraisers all aimed at raising awareness for cardiovascular disease. But what exactly is cardiovascular disease?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you remember from high school biology, the cardiovascular system is the system in the body that includes the heart (cardio) and the blood vessels (vascular). Our major blood vessels are arteries, which carry blood away (<strong>a</strong>way - <strong>a</strong>rteries) from the heart, and veins (<em>veins</em><em>drain</em> the body into the heart), which carry blood to the heart. This system is crucial, as the blood that travels through our blood vessels brings important nutrients to every cell in the body.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Cardiovascular disease is a class of disease. This means that under the umbrella of cardiovascular disease, you will find a number of diagnoses where the normal functions of the heart and blood vessels are disrupted or impaired. This includes<a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106""> heart attacks</a>, <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113"">strokes</a>, <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-tell-if-you-have-a-blood-clot"">blood clots</a>, <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angina/symptoms-causes/syc-20369373"">angina</a>, <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-aortic-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20350188"">aortic aneurysms</a>, and many more.The diagnoses range from slow to fast killers, but all have the potential to be lethal.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This is why making choices that work to prevent cardiovascular disease are important. Here is a short list of things you can do every day to lower your risk of developing cardiovascular disease:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list --><ul><li>Get <em>at least </em>30 minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity every day</li><li>Do not smoke</li><li>Limit alcohol consumption</li><li>Eat a balanced diet, low in processed and refined foods</li><li>Work on stress management to keep your general stress levels low</li><li>Get adequate sleep (7 - 9 hours)</li><li>Avoid spending too much time in areas with high levels of air pollution</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The final key point to know about cardiovascular disease is that there is an element to the disease that is genetic. If you know that your family is at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, then you will want to incorporate as many of the previously mentioned lifestyle choices into your life to minimize the risk of developing serious cardiovascular complications.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9909,2020-02-09 19:34:12,2020-02-10 00:34:12,closed,open,fff-quickreads-what-is-cardiovascular-disease,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9913,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,,,,,,,,,shared_counts,,,,,,,,shared_counts_datetime,1595044974,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But how exactly do you get the benefits of cardio training? What is the minimum effective dose of cardio and how can you test your progression?&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In a lab setting you could test your <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max"">VO2 Max</a> using a fancy machine that calculates your oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange at maximum effort. This would provide you with the most accurate reading of your VO2 Max. With that you could create a very specific training plan to increase this value and systematically improve your cardiovascular health.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In reality the majority of us do not have access to this type of equipment, nor do we need this level of accuracy to plan our training.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This is where <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health/RPE"">RPE</a>, or rate of perceived exertion, can be extremely helpful. The scale, which goes from 1-10, is an easy way for you to report your perceived level of effort. The scale typically coincides with the percentage of your maximum heart rate you’re training at as well. For example if you report an RPE of 5-6, this typically means you’re training at 50-60% of your predicted maximum heart rate.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>When you are training to improve cardio fitness, you ideally want to be somewhere between a 6 and an 8. In this zone you’re likely feeling slightly breathless, to being able to say just a few words at a time during the exercise.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This scale is great for training because your individual perception of exertion is unique to you. So instead of saying everyone needs to train on a treadmill for 20 minutes at 7km/h at an incline of 40% in order to improve their cardio fitness, we can adjust the time and effort level so that it works with your individual rate of perceived exertion.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Related Article: </strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/cardio-before-or-after-you-workout/"">Cardio Before or After Your Workout?</a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So now that you know what level of intensity you need to train at in order to improve your cardio fitness, how do we track progress?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are a few ways to do this.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The first method would be to perform the same cardio exercise every training session and track your RPE after every session. As soon as you drop below a 6, you can increase the intensity of the exercise and start a new phase of your cardio training.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The other method would be to try and train at the same level of RPE and track the time you train for at that level, the pace (if you have a machine, or a smart watch for outdoor activities).&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The last way to track your cardio fitness progress is to pick the RPE you want to train at and perform your exercise. At the end of the workout, check your heart rate. You can do this with most smartphones, smart watches, or the old-fashioned way with your pulse at the wrist.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For the latter technique, take your index and middle finger to your wrist and find your pulse. Once you’ve found it, start a timer for 15s and count the number of beats you feel in that time. Take that number and multiply it by 4. That’s your beats per minute.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Once you have your active beats per minute, set a timer and check your pulse regularly until it returns to around 100bpm. Stop the timer. After every session repeat this process. If you are training at the right intensity, the time that it takes for your heart to return to ~100bpm will decrease. The better your cardio fitness level, the better your heart is at recovering.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In summary, if you want to improve your cardio fitness and therefore decrease your risk of cardiovascular disease you can do so in these ways:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list --><ul><li>Train at an RPE of 6-8 (on a scale of 1-10)</li><li>Every training session either try to train for longer at that RPE, or train until your RPE drops below 6.<ul><li>At this point, increase the intensity of your training.</li></ul></li><li>Keep track of the RPE, time, and distance of each training session to track your progress</li><li>To take your tracking to the next level, record your active heart rate, and then time how long it takes for your heart to return to ~100bpm.<ul><li>As this time decreases, your cardio fitness level is increasing.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""small""} --><p class=""has-small-font-size""><strong>Author: <a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/team/riley-pearce/"">Riley Pearce</a></strong><br><a href=""mailto:riley.pearce.fff@gmail.com"">riley.pearce.fff@gmail.com</a><br>Director of Social Media<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,9989,2020-02-24 07:46:22,2020-02-24 12:46:22,closed,open,is-your-cardio-health-improving,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,9990,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,60,shared_counts,,shared_counts_datetime,1595257108,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,,,,,,,,,snap_MYURL,,,,,,,,snapEdIT,1,2,_yoast_wpseo_focuskw,cardio health,_yoast_wpseo_metadesc,"How can you measure whether or not your cardio health is actually improving?

How we move, what we eat, and the quality of our sleep can all either help or hinder our biological ageing. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>A <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200225122954.htm"">recent study</a> out of Concordia University has found that obesity could be the main driver for faster biological ageing. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The lead researcher actually started the project after noticing that young children were being diagnosed with adult-onset diseases like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The research team reviewed over 200 studies that report the effects of obesity on the body from the cellular level up to the full systemic, bodily function level. Aside from the obvious, that obesity leads to premature death, the researchers found a number of other observations that were able to confirm their theory that obesity mirrors ageing.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are a number of signs of ageing. On the cellular level, our genes have a cap known as telomeres. Telomeres, in recent years, have been found to be a good indicator of health on the cellular level. The longer the telomeres, the healthier the cells, whereas the shorter the telomeres, the less healthy that individual likely is.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In obese patients, they found that their telomere length was up to 25% shorter than the control patients. This means that no matter how old you are chronologically, if someone is obese, their biological age will be much older.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The researchers also found that obesity mirrors ageing in the areas of cognitive decline, mobility, and blood pressure. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Going beyond the cells, obesity puts individuals at a higher risk of developing certain diseases because not only does it age the cells of the body, but also the systems. More specifically, obesity will age the immune system, making an individual less resilient to pathogens.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The stress that the extra weight puts on the systems of the body requires the body to work very hard. This is potentially why obesity mirrors ageing at this level. Think about driving a car. If you drive your car just a few kilometres every day, the car will last longer and won’t get run down so quickly. Now if you take that same car and drive it 100’s of kilometres every day, the chances of that car breaking down increase exponentially.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Our bodies are very good at keeping us alive. They will do whatever it takes, even if it means over-exhausting resources just to keep up moving every day. It is already very clear to us as a society that obesity is a health risk we all need to be aware of. With this new research, it becomes even more apparent that we need systems in place to lower the rates of obesity within our society so that our communities can live longer lives.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""small""} --><p class=""has-small-font-size""><strong>Author: <a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/team/riley-pearce/"">Riley Pearce</a></strong><br><a href=""mailto:riley.pearce.fff@gmail.com"">riley.pearce.fff@gmail.com</a><br>Director of Social Media<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,10030,2020-03-02 07:46:45,2020-03-02 12:46:45,closed,open,new-research-on-the-link-between-ageing-and-obesity,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,10031,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,30,shared_counts,,shared_counts_datetime,1594869762,_wp_old_slug,new-research-on-the-link-between-aging-and-obesity,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,,,,,,,,_snap_forceSURL,2,,,,,,,snap_MYURL,,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_focuskw,obesity and ageing,_yoast_wpseo_metadesc,New research has discovered some shocking similarities between the effects of ageing and the effects of obesity on the human body.,_yoast_wpseo_linkdex,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chances of you getting sick and feeling run down at this time of year are especially high. Fortunately, our bodies are equipped with an immune system that can be strengthened by our daily decisions.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p> Our immune system is our body’s way of protecting us from ailments and some diseases. It keeps the body strong when a foreign invader tries to break us down is one of the many systems that make it possible for us to live as long as we do.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As with many of the complex systems in our body, what we eat, how we sleep, and what activities we take part in can all strengthen or weaken the immune system. Even the simple fact of ageing will inevitably take its toll on the strength of the immune system.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For example, what we eat and therefore the bacteria that we promote in the gut can have a major impact on the strength of our immune system. In fact 60-70% of the immune cells actually exist in the gut. This makes your gut the mission control for all immune activities.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Research has observed that there are specific types of foods that help to promote the proliferation of healthy gut bacteria, and the growth of bacteria that will actually help to eliminate unhealthy gut bacteria. The foods that are the best for this are <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6117398/"">fermented foods</a> like kimchi, kombucha, and fermented yogurts.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you want to specifically boost the immune-boosting bacteria in the gut, research shows that a group of bacteria known as the <a href=""https://www.meiji.com/global/about-us/research-and-development/food-and-nutrition/research-library/r-1-lactobacillus/"">R-1 lactic acid bacteria</a> are particularly effective in this area of gut health. The best source of this type of lactic acid bacteria (<a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02899/full"">LAB</a>) is <strong>fermented, plain yogurt</strong> known as kefir. This type of bacteria has been shown to boost the activity of Natural Killer cells (NK cells), which are the cells that circulate the body in search of those foreign invaders we mentioned before.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you have a dairy intolerance or if you don’t enjoy yogurt, you can take a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4439985/"">LAB probiotic supplement.</a> Some studies have even shown that by taking a LAB probiotic, subjects see an increase in their tolerance for dairy.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Besides eating fermented foods, you’ll also want to follow all of the classic recommendations for good health. These include:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list --><ul><li>Getting fresh air</li><li>Spending time in the sun to boost vitamin D stores</li><li>Drinking lots of water to help flush out toxins</li><li>Eating whole foods, focusing on nutrient rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and locally raised meat</li><li>Avoid smoking, excessive drinking, processed foods, and sedentary behaviour</li><li>Get at least 7-9 hours of sleep every night</li><li>Keep stress levels low by practicing meditation, going for walks in nature, and other healthy and natural stress-reducing strategies</li><li>Get at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day.</li><li>Wash your hands**</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This flu season may seem more ominous than most flu seasons.

Jobs change, accidents happen, and sometimes the world is put on quarantine due to a novel coronavirus. When these things happen our routines can change a lot. With a change in the routine, it can be very easy to fall out of good healthy habits like exercising and meal prepping.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The upside to understanding that life will always have some challenges waiting to throw off our schedule, is that we can prepare ourselves for the inevitable routine change. Creating a contingency plan that is adaptable to any kind of change in routine means that you safeguard all of the good habits you create in your normal life, and you never have to worry about “falling off the wagon”.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Schedule Your Time Day-By-Day or Week-By-Week</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Or both! Depending on the situation, you’ll want to get organized as soon as possible. Create a sense of order so that you feel prepared for every day. The more organized you are the better your chances will be of staying active, being productive, and maintaining good eating habits.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Get Creative With Your At-Home Fitness Routine</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>When you have full access to a gym and the grocery stores are fully stocked you can make your goals whatever you would like them to be. When most facilities are closed and the grocery stores are running low on some non-perishable items, we need to adjust our goals to suit the conditions.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you are reading this, there is a good chance that you have some kind of routine around going to a gym or fitness class a few times per week. In the case of the coronavirus, most of these facilities will be closed, so you’ll have to find an alternative to this that works from home, but also helps keep you active.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Most fitness facilities are offering online options in order to support their clients through this time. There are also many other options to support your fitness during this time.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For example - Fitbit has built-in challenges where you can challenge friends to step competitions. If you don’t have Fitbit, you can create group chats and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/521498932123497/"">Facebook groups</a> amongst friends to hold each other accountable. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Have fun with recipes you’ve always wanted to try</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With more time on your hands at home, now is a great time to try those recipes you’ve always wanted to try. Get the whole family in on the cooking fun and take this opportunity to educate yourself and your family on the benefits of whole foods and important nutrients.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Make Fitness the First Thing You Do Everyday</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you want to keep fitness a priority, make it the first thing you do every day. Get up and go for a walk with the dog or the kids (or both!). Make your meal plan for the day. Drink 1L of water before noon. Set the tone for the whole day as soon as it starts.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As the old saying goes - when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.

Woman tying shoes for at-home workout."" class=""wp-image-10109""/></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>At-home workouts are a great way to exercise from the comforts of your home. One of the biggest challenges with at-home workouts is the fact that there is no one to hold you accountable; your bedroom, the kitchen, the tv and other household distractions are more tempting than a workout (sometimes); and the equipment is limited.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Getting physical activity at this time is more important than ever. It should be everyone’s priority to keep themselves in good health. Self-isolating and social-distancing are how we are protecting our fellow neighbours from the spread of the novel coronavirus. With our community taken care of, we should all be focusing inward on our own health. Here are a few ways you can make sure you are successful with at-home workouts.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Make an appointment</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Health officials are advising that we maintain a good routine during this time. Take a moment at the beginning of every day to plan out what you have to do. Make sure you leave <em>at least</em> 30 minutes in the day for intentional physical activity. Yes walking around the grocery store, or going from downstairs to upstairs will get your daily steps up, but you want to set aside 30 minutes to be intentional about your health.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Not only will this ensure you are getting physical activity every day, but it will create the routine. Your body will get used to being intentionally physically active, which will work well when we can all return to our usual workout facilities.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Have someone who holds you accountable</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>After you have scheduled time in your day to get your workout done, find someone you trust to hold you accountable. Maybe it is your trainer, or your spouse, or a friend that you speak with regularly.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Whoever you choose, just make sure that you choose someone who will check in on you and make sure you are getting the workout done when you planned to.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Even if the day changes, that person can also be there to support you and help you find another time in your day. Not only should you find someone, but be that someone for someone you care about. Encouraging an active lifestyle with the ones you love really helps to make fitness part of your lifestyle.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Have a plan for your workout</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Okay - so you know when you’re working out, you have someone to hold you accountable, now it is time to figure out <em>what</em> you’ll be doing. Starting with the type of workout is a great place to start. Will it be full-body, upper body, lower body, core, or maybe even a mobility session? Once you know what your goal is for the workout, then you can begin to choose your exercises.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><em>If you are an active member of Free Form Fitness, speak with your trainer about the option to set up a remote session. Then the “what” of your at-home workout is taken care of.</em></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you are not currently a member of Free Form Fitness, there are a number of different ways you can plan your workouts. Just be mindful of your current fitness level, the equipment you have available (if any), and if you have any pre-existing injuries that need to be considered. This is a great time to learn how to listen and trust your body in movement.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Know that it is okay that your workouts will not be the same as they are at the gym</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One of the biggest mental barriers to working out from home is knowing that it won’t be the same as your gym sessions. For the time being it is important to adopt a mindset of patience and flexibility. Yes, you won’t be able to lift the heavy weights or use the fancy equipment, but you will still get a great workout if you follow the above recommendations. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you take some time to look into <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/calisthenics"">callisthenics,</a> you’ll see that there is a whole side of physical fitness that is solely reliant on bodyweight. As mentioned above - this is a great time to learn how to listen and trust your body in movement.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Get the family on board</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Having family around can make workouts from home more exciting <strong><em>if</em></strong> you plan for it and get the family on board. Include physical activity in the family’s schedule for the day. This way everyone gets the physical activity they need at this time and the family can take this time together to bond. In the busy world we live in taking this time to enjoy your family’s company is one of the hidden benefits of self-isolation.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you like your workout time to be <em>your workout time</em>, then ask your spouse to care for the children for the time it takes you to finish your workout. If you have very young children, take advantage of their nap times to get your workouts in.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If it is a priority for you, then there is always time for a workout in the day.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Last, but certainly not least, remember your warm-up and cool down.</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Getting up from your home office, or the couch, and jumping into a workout can mean feeling stiff and weak when you begin to workout. Nothing is more discouraging than starting a workout feeling stiff and weak.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Set aside 5-10 minutes to do a quick warm-up before your workout begins. This can mean doing a few sets of stairs, jogging on the spot, or doing a simple yoga flow (there’s tons of them online). Whatever elevates your heart rate, and warms up the joints and muscles will make a huge difference in your workout. Not to mention it reduces your risk of injury. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As for your cool down, take just 5-10 minutes to lower the heart rate down to a resting level, and switch the body from “workout mode” to recovery mode. Running from your workout the next virtual meeting, or errand with the kids will keep your internal stress levels high. This could leave you feeling burnt out by the end of the day.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Although working out from home requires a little more patience and planning from the individual, it is entirely possible and it is a great way to make your health a priority at this time when it is arguably more important than ever.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""small""} --><p class=""has-small-font-size""><strong>Author: <a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/team/riley-pearce/"">Riley Pearce</a></strong><br><a href=""mailto:riley.pearce.fff@gmail.com"">riley.pearce.fff@gmail.com</a><br><strong>Director of Social Media</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,10108,2020-03-23 08:08:25,2020-03-23 12:08:25,closed,open,how-to-be-successful-with-at-home-workouts,publish,0,0,post,,0,category,uncategorized,Uncategorized,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,10109,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,60,shared_counts,,shared_counts_datetime,1595162852,shared_counts_total,35,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,,,,,,,,_snap_forceSURL,2,,,,,,,snap_MYURL,,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_focuskw,at-home workouts,_yoast_wpseo_metadesc,"At-home workouts are more popular than ever.

Now that we are all at home and the usual hustle and bustle of our daily lives have been put on hold, we are realizing that self-care is more important than ever. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We were not meant to be stuck inside, limiting contact with other humans, which makes this social-distancing situation problematic.

Set aside time every day, for intervals of at least 10 minutes at a time, to get up and move.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The movement doesn’t need to be an all-out workout either. You <em>can</em> follow a workout via remote sessions, or a workout video, but you can also do the stairs in your home or apartment building for a couple of minutes, you can work on your squat form, drop down and hold a plank or practice your pushup technique.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Best of all is getting outside and moving in the fresh air. If there is one good thing about the lockdowns, is that it is happening during spring. The sun is coming back and the outdoors are becoming more inviting. Take advantage of this and breathe in that crisp, fresh, spring air.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Find quiet time</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Being at home all the time means that you’re constantly surrounded by noise. Someone is making food in the kitchen, the kids are playing, you are getting alerts on your computer for the next meeting.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>You may not even realize while it is happening, but all of that sensory input can exhaust the mind and body. So find time for quiet.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If the home is a busy place, go outside without headphones and take a walk in the peace of nature. If you are able to at home, turn off as many of the “buzzing” appliances and fixtures as you can. Turn off your phone and mute your computer and just enjoy the silence for a few minutes.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>These little moments of silence will help recharge the brain and make you feel more alert and settled for the next set of tasks.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Learn to listen to your body</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>You will have a lot more time for meal prep and recipe research. During this time explore new foods, remind yourself of foods that fueled you, and learn how to listen to your body.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Learn to know when that hunger pang is hunger or boredom. Listen to the headaches and figure out the real source - like dehydration, stress, or sugar cravings - instead of just taking something for it immediately.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Be aware of the bathroom and what that can tell you about your internal health.

Center of mass transitions involve holding a specific position for 5-10 seconds <em>and</em> being able to transition (wink, wink…<em>weight-shift</em>) directly into another position.&nbsp; </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Irregular Loads &amp; Irregular Platforms</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This is a classic tool that is the easiest to “import” from your gym experience.&nbsp; An irregular load is anything that has weight to it (not necessarily a lot of weight though) that is either held or positioned o<em>ff-center</em> from your body OR that possesses some intrinsic irregularity in the distribution of its mass (more specifically, DEAD WEIGHT).&nbsp; </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Holding or placing something off-center is easy and your only limitation is creativity, but dead-weight is where you can maximize (if not ENHANCE) your self-isolation/quarantine exercise experience.  </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Small children are the ideal dead weight and by using appropriate (and expected) parental wisdom in how you “use” them, they will definitely enhance the activation of the deeper postural apparatus (spine, shoulder girdle, pelvic girdle, hips).&nbsp; </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Irregular platforms are also “imports” from the gym.&nbsp; Something as familiar as a Bosu ball is perhaps the most recognizable unstable platform tool however, there are still ways to hack into your postural structures and systems in a very efficient and effective way.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The BOSU ball is indeed unstable but there is still some ‘regularity’ in its instability (it is perfectly spherical).&nbsp; The key terms to integrate is <strong><em>IRREGULAR. </em></strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In simple terms, this means that each point of contact (hands, feet, knees, butt, etc…) is engaging with the ground in a different way.&nbsp; </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Quick example</strong>:&nbsp; Deep squats with one foot on a cushion or pillow and the other foot planted on the ground (all the while maintaining good form).

Is there a limit to these efforts where too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Immunity Backfiring</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Our immune systems are complex and work best when a myriad of signals and responses work together to eliminate foreign pathogens from the body. In the ideal situation, you want your body to send <strong>just the right amount</strong> of a response to the crisis hot spot, enveloping the foreign invader in pathogen-fighting juices and killing it before it can proliferate and cause any real damage.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are some interim processes that occur, such as inflammation, and fever, which all signal that the body is working hard to send make your internal environment uncomfortable for the pathogen.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Sometimes these efforts backfire and cause something called a <strong><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3294426/"">cytokine storm</a></strong><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3294426/"">.&nbsp;</a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Cytokine Storm</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Cytokines are one of the many proteins that are involved in our regular immune responses. These particular proteins are responsible for the inflammatory response to foreign invaders.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In some cases, these proteins can be released in excess, and the inflammatory response is actually overwhelming for the body. This is especially worrisome in the case of coronaviruses like the novel coronavirus, SARS, and MERS.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>By overproducing inflammation and creating these cytokine storms, the body is actually over-reacting to the virus and this allows the virus to proliferate. This is why very young people typically experience little to no symptoms to COVID-19, as their immune systems are less developed and so they have less of a response from the cytokine proteins.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>The upside</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><br>“Boosting” the immune system to a level where it is able to get out of control is actually really difficult.

The <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200408-covid-19-can-boosting-your-immune-system-protect-you"">research</a> shows that vitamin D deficiency has been linked to a greater risk of developing respiratory infections.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For optimal health, aim for <strong>25-100 micrograms</strong> of vitamin D/day.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With the summer sun making its way back to the northern hemisphere we will not need to supplement vitamin D.

Do they refer to research studies in their videos, or are they based on their personal experience?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The final thing to remember when watching YouTubers in this demographic is that they are all coming from their own individual history of health and fitness. They may have grown up an athlete, and therefore being healthy and fit comes more naturally to them. If they make it look easy to look the way they do, it is probably because - biologically - it is for them. Just keep that in mind as you watch those YouTubers.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>YouTube can be a fun and easy way to learn more about health and fitness.

Tess demonstrated how she gets her kids involved in her workouts. This inspired us to share tips with you to help you get your kids to love your workouts.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Give your child/children a role in the workout that they can be excited about</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In Tess’s video, you see her 3 kids lined up and waiting to play their part. You know that a lot of what parenting is is giving children opportunities to be independent or to show them the value of being a team player. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Tess started by writing down her workout and giving her eldest the whiteboard to read off of. As the oldest his reading skills are likely the most advanced, so he would feel confident, and excited, to show off his reading skills while his Mom worked out. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The second oldest told her mom how many reps she had to do. She may not be at a reading age yet, but she could count confidently. This kept her engaged and also gave her a chance to practice her counting. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Lastly, the youngest was in charge of making the workout difficult for her mom. She may not have been able to read confidently or count accurately, but there is still a role for her. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As you watch the video you'll notice each of the kids is excited to be part of the workout. This also shows them at a young age that exercise and moving your body can be a fun family activity.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Instilling these values of health, movement, and family playtime have all been shown to help develop <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5833469/"">healthy habits</a> in children that will last their whole lives.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Create Workouts That Feel Like Play</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>You should try to plan at least 1 work out per week that involves kid-friendly movements. These exercises feel more like play, and will also help you move your body in a new way, which has been shown to lead to better training results. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Some form of running would an obvious choice, but you won’t want to simply create a running track in the park for the kids to do laps. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Did you ever like running laps as a kid? We’d guess that’s probably a no.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Creating an obstacle course is a great alternative. Start by taking household items to mark the different workout stations so it is easier for the kids to remember what to do at each section. Things like a soccer ball or basketball can act as something for you and the kids to squat down to (or just above). You can grab a box, or even just a shoe, and make this something to do bunny hops over. Also, make sure to bring a mat or a towel so you can include a push-up station.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>These types of obstacle course activities are a great way to get yourself and the kids moving in the fresh air now that the warmer weather finally has arrived and the parks have re-opened. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Getting creative with your workouts and finding ways to involve the kids is a win-win situation. You get the workout that you want to get and are able to maintain a good workout routine. The kids get to spend time with their parents, they burn off energy, and they’ll start seeing the fun of exercising at an early age.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,10166,2020-05-11 03:24:16,2020-05-11 07:24:16,closed,open,how-to-get-your-kids-to-love-your-workouts,publish,0,0,post,,0,,,,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,10168,_edit_last,4,xyz_fbap,1,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_focuskw,,,,,,,,,_yoast_wpseo_metadesc,Finding it hard to work out with kids around?

The question is, how do we make the most of the virtual training experience? You may not have the same equipment as the gym, nor will you have the same opportunities to communicate, or check-in with your trainer. For this, we have 3 tips to help you make the most of your virtual sessions.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Tip #1</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Schedule More Than Just Sessions</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>When you schedule your training sessions, speak with your trainer about also scheduling in other important appointments.

This way they can send you resources, like recipes and grocery lists to help you stay on track.</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Tip #2</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Provide regular feedback</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the old training environment, you’d be able to have full conversations with your trainer about life at home, work-life, and anything else that is going on in your life. Now that everything is online and at a distance, your trainers have less of an understanding of your current situation than ever.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Your trainer takes just about everything into account when making your programs and providing nutrition and healthy-habit-advice.

One of the best ways to make the most of your virtual training is to get curious about your health.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you have a random question, search it. Read whatever articles come up, and then discuss it with your trainer.

So this idea of super-spreaders is one we should all be looking into.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the article, they provided a graph of businesses (shown below) represented as large and small bubbles. The size of the bubbles indicates the risk of passing or contracting the virus. On the left side of the graph was the amount of time people typically spend at each location. The lower part of the graph gave us a sense of how many times a single person would visit these businesses.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image --><figure class=""wp-block-image""><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vjN1aF_RGWj7ORZZDqyhRE07wDyk0LCzkI6iMaHYpg5KMM5JympSxCsHLwGw-pI8uKIuSy1Dt_l0loz9KyDWzCrcvZr7Bi19-DcZCtVsi6lHA7IXTpYcFv7bAdsj6DZx4wdVM_Qf"" alt=""New York Times graph displaying the risk of businesses falling into the category of super-spreaders""/><figcaption><br><em>Image source: The New York Times﻿</em></figcaption></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The highlighted area of the graph shown here gives us an idea of the risk of gyms. Their analysis of the gyms as super-spreaders says that although visitors have more space, they tend to linger. Based on the graph, they determined that the majority of people are spending 40 minutes or more at the gym.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This brings us to why the Free Form Fitness model actually works in favour of these metrics.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>We are small, but we will be capping patrons in the gym at one time</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As we open we will only allow a maximum of 3 clients and 3 trainers in the gym at one time. Our larger facilities - <a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/ottawa/albert/"">Albert st</a>. and <a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/ottawa/kanata/"">Kanata</a> - can handle more, so you may see an additional trainer and client in those locations. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Sessions will also be <strong>by appointment only</strong>. This means that clients can only be in the gym for their scheduled appointment. Unfortunately, clients will not be able to stay after their session to do cardio or come in on their own time. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For your warm-up, we will be implementing <strong>new outdoor warm-up areas</strong>. To help you warm-up for your session, we will be creating warm-ups on our signs outside - you know the ones with the motivating - and sometimes silly - messages? Please also dress accordingly for these outdoor warm-ups.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Enhanced Cleaning Standards</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Keeping our facilities clean has always been a priority. In response to the pandemic, we will be <strong>stepping up our cleaning game</strong>. Hand sanitizer will be available for you to use before, during, and after your sessions. Equipment will be wiped down after every use using our hospital-grade cleaner. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Trainers are being asked to do thorough cleanings on breaks, before and after clients, and before they leave the gym. This will ensure that the gyms are staying as clean as possible. We also encourage you to bring disinfectant wipes to help us clean the spaces used by clients.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With that said, our showers will be off-limits for the time being. We also will not be offering our usual towel service, so as to limit the spread of germs. Please bring your own towel, and be prepared to shower at home after your session.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Masks &amp; Gloves in the gym</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Although not required by the government, we ask you to wear a mask in the gym. All of our trainers will be wearing masks during sessions to protect themselves. Should you forget your own mask, we will be selling masks for $3.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As we mentioned in a previous article, gloves are not mandatory. <a href=""https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/ottawa-public-health-does-not-recommend-wearing-gloves-during-pandemic-dr-etches-1.4945517"">Ottawa Public Health</a> has said that washing hands regularly is more effective than gloves at preventing the spread of germs. If you feel safer wearing gloves, then we encourage you to take any precautions that put your mind at ease.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Lastly,<strong> if you think that you are sick, please do not come to the gym</strong>. Our 24-hour cancellation policy <strong>will not be</strong> in effect for the time being. If you suspect that someone you came in contact with was sick, please avoid the gym until you can confirm you are not sick. If you exhibit any of the symptoms - dry cough and fever - please do not come to the gym. The best way we can ensure we are not super-spreaders is to be diligent about this.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>When you return to the gym you’ll also notice new signage to remind clients of the new rules in the gym. Please refer to these signs if you are ever unsure about protocols we have put in place.

134,Virtual Training vs. In-Person Training,https://freeformfitness.ca/virtual-training-vs-in-person-training/,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 08:40:24 +0000",riley.pearce,false,https://freeformfitness.ca/?p=10278,"<!-- wp:heading --><h2>Know their differences so you can choose the right offering for you!</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As the world is likely well settled into the virtual way of doing things, it is time to consider virtual training vs. in-person training. How can you expect virtual training to differ from in-person training? We have come up with a definitive list of pros and cons to compare the two offerings. By the end of this article, you should feel confident in what style of training will suit your lifestyle.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Virtual Pro: Workout Wherever You Are</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Sometimes the commute to the gym takes too long. Sometimes you’re out of town visiting family. When travel for work and vacations restarts, you may be away from the gym on an unpredictable schedule. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With virtual training, all of these scenarios are no longer a barrier to meeting with your trainer. Sure - the equipment or space may vary, but a skilled personal trainer can work with any space and all equipment.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Consistency is key when you are working towards a goal. In this case, virtual training vs. in-person training means you can keep your training schedule consistent vs. working it around your unpredictable schedule. This will lead to more consistent results - and who doesn’t like consistently seeing results from their efforts?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Virtual Con: Receiving Feedback Through a Screen</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It is great that you can workout wherever you are, but what about when you want to learn a new exercise? One of the many benefits of working with a personal trainer is that they can provide you with instant feedback on your technique. They can also provide specific cues to help you to perform exercises as safely as possible. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>An example of this would be the pushup. When you lower your body to do a pushup, you want to keep the body as rigid and straight as possible so you move as one unit - instead of the hips, head, and chest moving in 3 different parts. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>A trainer can catch this, and poke or guide specific areas of the body to give you an external cue while working out. These <a href=""https://www.acefitness.org/education-and-resources/professional/expert-articles/7324/internal-vs-external-cueing-how-to-help-your-clients-move-more-efficiently-and-effectively/"">external cues</a> can be very helpful for people who find it difficult to connect the mind to their specific muscles. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>With that said, a skilled trainer will be aware of your individual fitness level and will only program exercises that are effective and safe for your current fitness level. This is why assessments, and providing as much verbal feedback to your trainer as possible is important.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-virtual-training/""><strong>Related Article: How To Make The Most of Your Virtual Training Sessions</strong></a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Virtual Pro: Your Program at Your Fingertips</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Virtual training puts all elements of training online. It requires a trainer to provide absolutely every piece of necessary information to the client via the online training platform. This means that you’ll see your workout program, your measurements, and any other important information on your phone, tablet, or laptop. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For those of you who like to know what to expect from workouts, or who like to check back to measurements, this is a great benefit to you. If you are someone who enjoyed a specific exercise from a past workout but can never remember - well now you have it on hand. You can practice it and perfect it, and ultimately look forward to more exercises in your workouts.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In this virtual training vs. in-person training showdown, virtual training gives you greater access to your training data. You have always been able to request your programs and measurements from your trainer. In this case, however, they are delivered to you right away.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Virtual Con: Technical Difficulties</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Ever hear the expression “technology is great… when it works.”? This can be true and frustrating in virtual sessions. Sometimes the wi-fi cuts out, or devices run out of battery. You can even get a call during your session, which will take you out of <em>""the zone.""</em></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Virtual training is great when all of the technical pieces can fall together easily. Here are a few tips to avoid any technical difficulties:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list --><ul><li>Be sure that you are somewhere that has a reliable wi-fi connection or you have enough data to support the session online. </li><li>Always charge your devices before the session, have the devices plugged in and charging during the session. Streaming and video calls can use a lot of battery in a short period of time, so always be prepared for that. </li><li>To avoid getting unnecessary calls, put the training appointment in your work calendar so no one from work calls unless it is an absolute emergency.</li><li>You can also put your phone on 'Do Not Disturb Mode'.</li><li> If you <em>really</em> don't want to be bothered, there's always airplane mode. This will allow you to keep wi-fi on but turn off all other phone functions. </li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p> Where there’s a will, there is a way (to make our devices work when we need them to).</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Virtual Pro: Workout When It Suits Your (Kid's) Schedule</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Although our training sessions are efficient and just 30 minutes, sometimes the appointments available just do not work. You may have a newborn, or kids that need someone home with them. Now you can workout when it works in your/their schedule. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Not only will it suit your schedule, but you’ll also be just a few steps away from the kids. Whether they are taking a nap or playing with friends, you can have the peace of mind that you’re only a few steps away if they wake up or need your help.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In this virtual training vs. in-person training case, virtual training takes into account that kid's schedules are unpredictable. As a parent to young children, their needs come before yours 99% of the time. Virtual training lets you be available to them while also tending to your health.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Virtual Con: Distractions</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>On that same note, sometimes having the dedicated gym space is <em>exactly</em> what you need. Getting out of the house/office and taking 30 minutes to really focus on yourself might be important to you. In this case, virtual training may add an element of unwelcome distraction to your training sessions. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you wanted to try virtual training but were worried about distractions, try to schedule sessions when the kids have a playdate. Or, if you have a partner/spouse, have them watch the kids so you can focus on your session. As a last resort, you can always schedule your calls in the evening after the kids have gone to bed.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Virtual training is an exciting new way to train. It allows frequent travellers, new parents, and busy-bees the opportunity to fit their sessions into their life in a way that works for them. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>You may have realized from this list that virtual training is not for you, and that’s okay too!

Now, what's the best way to achieve those goals?</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Goal setting and working towards goals is an important part of the human experience. It gives us purpose and direction every day. It can be a cause for celebration or a cause for reflection. Health and fitness goals are an important set of goals. Pursuing good health and improve quality of life. But is personal training the best option to help you achieve those goals? </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>How will a personal trainer help you achieve your goals faster? How can a trainer help you avoid frustrating plateaus, and losing motivation-momentum? Is a trainer really the best option for your set of health goals? By the end of this article, you'll be able to confidently answer all of these questions.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Goal Setting Recap</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Before we get into how a personal trainer can help you achieve your goals, let’s first revisit how to set great goals.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>An easy format to follow is the <strong>SMART</strong> goals method. SMART is an acronym for <strong>Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, and Time-sensitive</strong>.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":10284,""align"":""left"",""linkDestination"":""custom""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""alignleft""><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FFF-Goal-Setting-Worksheet-1.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FFF-Goal-Setting-Worksheet-232x300.png"" alt=""Set SMART goals worksheet"" class=""wp-image-10284""/></a></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Your goals need to be <strong>specific</strong> and <strong>measurable</strong>. Let’s say you want to look and feel better. How can you rephrase that so it is more specific and measurable? How about saying you want to lose an inch off of your waist. Or maybe you want to have the energy to walk up the stairs at work without feeling breathless. Both of these can result in you looking and feeling better, but now you have something you can measure in inches and breathlessness.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:file {""id"":10283,""href"":""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FFF-Goal-Setting-Worksheet-1.pdf"",""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-file aligncenter""><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FFF-Goal-Setting-Worksheet-1.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener""><strong>SMART Goal Setting Sheet (</strong><em><strong>free download - no email required</strong></em><strong>)</strong></a><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FFF-Goal-Setting-Worksheet-1.pdf"" class=""wp-block-file__button"" download>Download</a></div><!-- /wp:file --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Actionable</strong> goals are goals that have specific action steps that allow you to reach that goal. Going with the goals mentioned above, your action steps would be the specific daily or weekly actions you would take to get you to your goal. Action steps could include taking the stairs every day at work, or taking stairs whenever possible. You could make a plan to drink more water to help reduce bloating around your midsection. A great goal is usually comprised of smaller, daily goals that will result in the main goal being accomplished.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Lastly, your goals need to be <strong>realistic</strong> and <strong>time-sensitive</strong>. Can you improve your cardio health in a week? To some extent, but depending on where your fitness level is today, you may not be able to do the stairs at work without feeling a little breathless after the first week. For weight loss and weight gain goals, these are complex processes in the body, so be realistic about the time it takes to achieve these types of goals. For weight loss, sustainable weight loss occurs at around 0.5lbs - 1lb of weight loss per week. Weight gain is specific to each individual. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>A hairstylist analogy</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>To help explain how a personal trainer can make reaching your goals easier, let’s look at a simpler task - getting a good haircut.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As many of us have learned from the COVID-19 lockdown, cutting your own hair is possible, but requires a lot of research, special tools, and a lot of trust in yourself or the friend/family member cutting your hair.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the end, you may end up with a haircut that is anywhere from awful, to kind of close to what you were hoping for. This is a wide range of possibilities, and you really do not know where you’ll land on the spectrum until the haircut is done. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This is why many (if not all) of us go to a professional hairstylist/barber. We give them the styling, the length, and any other important specifics like if we need our hair to be able to fit into a ponytail, and then the hairstylist takes care of the rest. They’ll ask for your input throughout the haircut to make sure it is still what you want, and offer suggestions as they go through the cut and style. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the end, you have exactly what you were looking for, and you have it in far less time, and under far less stress than the haircuts at home.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>The trainer will give you the “haircut” without the headache</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Once you have set a health and fitness goal, it is now time to get started. But where do you start? How can you be sure that the efforts you make are actually going to work towards your goal?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>That’s where the personal trainer becomes the hairstylist in the previous analogy. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Personal trainers have done the research, completed the training, and are well equipped with the tools and resources. Similarly to the hairstylist, all you have to do is bring the trainer some information to your session. This includes your goals, your current lifestyle, and what you feel comfortable with in the gym. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The trainer will be able to create a unique plan that is designed to fit your goals. They'll also work within your comfort zone. Lastly, the plan will fit into your current lifestyle. This narrows down the possible outcomes from your efforts. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Trainers come with an additional benefit of being a point of accountability for you. Going through times of lower motivation is to be expected in life. Sometimes we just don’t feel like it. Your trainer has seen this and has likely experienced this themselves. This equips them with the tools and resources to get you through the loss of motivation-momentum and keep you consistent.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Ever hit a frustrating plateau in your training? Maybe you couldn’t beat a 10k time, or you lost the first 10lbs, but can’t seem to shift the scale any further. Trainers have the tools and resources for that as well. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>When you have a good relationship with your trainer, they can make any health goal much easier to accomplish. You’ll still have to put in the work, but it won’t be guesswork. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} --><h3><strong>Are trainers the </strong><strong><em>best</em></strong><strong> investment for your health and fitness goals?</strong></h3><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>You are reading this on a website of a personal training business. So you may think there will be bias in this answer. Let us tell you that the answer to this question is actually <em>it depends</em>.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Although personal training is certainly an effective and personalized approach to most health and fitness goals, sometimes personal training isn’t the right option. Personal training is a 1-1 service. If you just want to move, but don’t necessarily want that kind of individual attention, then other options like classes may be better options for you.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If your goals are more oriented to mindfulness and yoga practices, although many of our trainers encourage a multi-disciplinary approach to health and wellbeing, personal training may not be the <em>best</em><strong><em></em></strong>option for that type of goal.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So when is personal training the <em>best</em> option for your goals? </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list --><ul><li>You are someone who just wants to be told exactly how to get to their goals. </li><li>You want 1-1 guidance that provides you with the recipe for success for your personal journey, then personal training is the <em>best</em> option for you. </li><li>If you struggle with holding yourself accountable and have thought “oh they won’t even notice if I’m not in the class”, then personal training is the <em>best</em> option for you.</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you go back to your SMART goals, look at the 'A' step again. Actionable - what actions can you take to help you reach your goals. If hiring a personal trainer is the most reliable way to get you to your goals, then that’s where we fit in. Your actions on your journey to achieve your health goals will reflect your intentions of achieving those goals. <br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""small""} --><p class=""has-small-font-size"">Author: Riley Pearce<br>Director of Social Media &amp; Marketing<br><a href=""mailto:riley.pearce.fff@gmail.com"">riley.pearce.fff@gmail.com</a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,10282,2020-06-23 06:00:20,2020-06-23 10:00:20,closed,open,is-personal-training-the-best-option,publish,0,0,post,,0,,,,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,10285,_edit_last,4,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,25,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_focuskw,is personal training the best option,_yoast_wpseo_metadesc,,,,,,,,,_yoast_wpseo_linkdex,71,post_tag,goal-setting,goal setting,category,personal-trainer-articles,Personal Trainer Articles,_yoast_wpseo_content_score,90,"With so many other ways to achieve your fitness goals, how can you be sure if personal training is the best option?

Most people typically want to lose 10lbs to kick-start a larger weight loss goal. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We’ve all heard the adverts that claim you can lose 30lbs in a month, or get ripped abs in 2 weeks. These ads are exciting and attractive, but pretty unrealistic. If you're too aggressive with your weight loss, statistics show that the weight will return and bring a few extra lbs with it. To lose 10lbs in 5 weeks is a healthy, and realistic weight loss goal.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>As personal trainers, we are given a formula for how clients can lose weight in a healthy and sustainable way.

We are all about the personalized approach to fitness, and this process will help you achieve weight loss that is specific to you and your body.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Getting to know yourself goes beyond simply weighing yourself. In order to begin the weight loss process, you need to track your lifestyle for at least a week.

Throughout the journey take time to check in with yourself. What triggers stress and then stress eating? What are some activities that feel effortless and fun for you? If you do not lose the weight in the 5 weeks, how will you prepare yourself to continue on without feeling defeated? </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Our minds are incredibly powerful. It can be our greatest tool for success - or an inescapable source of pain.&nbsp; The more you check in on yourself, and remind yourself why you’re working towards weight loss, the better equipped you’ll be to maintain the weight loss. Try daily mantras, morning/evening affirmations, or simply working on making sure that voice inside your head is an encouraging one, and not a doubtful one.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So that’s all it takes! Get to know yourself and where you are right now. Adjust your energy intake and expenditure by 1000 Calories/day. Create your detailed nutrition and exercise plan (we can help with that). Stay consistent and work hard.

137,What Are The Most Important Details To Share With Your Trainer?,https://freeformfitness.ca/what-are-the-most-important-details-to-share-with-your-trainer/,"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 10:00:47 +0000",riley.pearce,false,https://freeformfitness.ca/?p=10405,"<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>You’ve just signed up for your first personal training session. You may be wondering what will the first session be like? What will the trainer give you as resources? How will they structure the session? These are all valid questions, but the answer to them actually starts with you. The beauty of personal training is that it is a personalized experience. So in order for your trainer to plan for that first session, and all subsequent sessions, you need to provide the trainer with a few important details.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>What is your goal here?</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The very first thing you want to share with your trainer is what you hope to achieve. Be as honest as possible about your goals. For example, if you are hoping to get in shape so you have more energy, balance, and mobility to play with grandchildren, then state that. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Think about your goals and then think about how achieving that goal will make your life better. Once you’ve figured out 1 or 2 reasons why your goal is important, then share this with the trainer. When your trainer understands the real-life implications of your goal, they can make the program truly personalized to you.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong><a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/is-personal-training-the-best-option/"">Related: Is Personal Training the Best Option</a></strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>What is your experience in the gym?</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Once your trainer has a clear idea of what you hope to achieve, it is now time to assess your experience in the gym.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Experience, in this case, has 2 meanings. The first is related to your fitness level. Have you been training? What types of equipment have you become comfortable with? Is there any equipment you are not comfortable with, or that you’d like to learn how to use? Again, you want to be as honest and detailed as possible here. If you really do not like a specific exercise, let the trainer know why and then they can avoid it, or show you modifications.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The second meaning relates to your experiences in a gym setting. Do you feel comfortable in the gym, or does it make you nervous (perfectly normal - it can be intimidating)? Did you ever have a really positive or negative experience at the gym? What made it so great or so awful?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Providing these details of your experience in the gym will help your trainer create a training environment that is the most positive and supportive to you. The more comfortable you feel at the gym, the better your chances will be of maintaining a consistent training regimen.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>What is life like outside of the gym?</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Your training sessions will be just 30 minutes out of a 24-hour day. This is why it is important to let your trainer know what life is like outside of the gym. Here are a few important details about your life outside the gym:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""id"":10406,""align"":""center"",""width"":291,""height"":291} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter is-resized""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Lifestyle-Information-to-Share-with-Your-Personal-Trainer_png-1024x1024.png"" alt=""6 important details about your life to share with your personal trainer. Family life, sleep habits, work life, stress levels, daily physical activity, dietary habits."" class=""wp-image-10406"" width=""291"" height=""291""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:list --><ul><li>Are you a parent? How busy are your kid’s schedules?</li><li>What are your work hours like? Are you 9-5, shift work, or working from home?</li><li>If you’re retired, what type of activities do you partake in throughout the week?</li><li>What are your stress levels like?</li><li>How much sleep do you typically get?</li><li><strong>What are your meal times like</strong> (rushed, with the family, grazer/snacker)</li><li>How else do you stay active throughout the week? (biking to work, taking the dog for a walk, playing in a beer-league)</li></ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If there is any other important daily-life information, definitely share that with your trainer. These are important details for your trainer to know because it helps your trainer create workouts that work within your lifestyle. If you lead a very stressful lifestyle, then the trainer can create a workout plan that acts as a stress-reduction method. If you are playing a sport, your workouts can be designed to strengthen certain sport-specific skills.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>What details are important to you?</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The final set of important details are the details that are important to you. Trainers have <em>a lot</em> of knowledge, but maybe you do not care about the science behind a specific exercise. Try thinking about what is important to you when it comes to exercise. Are you someone who loves to understand why you do things or are you perfectly happy just being told what to do?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This may take a few sessions to figure out. There is a lot to learn about exercise and the human body, but how much do you really care to learn? More importantly, how will the level of detail you receive actually help you achieve your goals?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Before we conclude the article you may be asking yourself “what about nutrition? Isn’t that an important detail?” Yes - sharing what your current diet is like is important to your trainer, but that falls under the daily-life set of important details.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>When you are sharing the details about your life outside the gym be sure to include the diets you have tried, how flexible you are with changing your diet, and the time that you have to prepare meals as well as eat meals. If making dietary recommendations are required to help you achieve your goals, then this information will help your trainer make personalized recommendations to you.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Whether you’re just starting your training or have been working with a trainer for a long time, be sure to share these important details with them. Be specific about why your goals are important to you. Let them know your experience and experiences at the gym so they can create a positive environment for you. Provide them with the details of your lifestyle for the other 23.5 hours of your day. Finally, let your trainer know what information is most important for you to know in order to be successful. With this information, your trainer can design the most personalized and goal-oriented training experience for you.<br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""small""} --><p class=""has-small-font-size""><strong>Author: <a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/team/riley-pearce/"">Riley Pearce</a></strong><br><a href=""mailto:riley.pearce.fff@gmail.com"">riley.pearce.fff@gmail.com</a><br>Director of Social Media &amp; Marketing</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->",,10405,2020-07-07 06:00:47,2020-07-07 10:00:47,closed,open,what-are-the-most-important-details-to-share-with-your-trainer,publish,0,0,post,,0,,,,taptap-hide-checkbox,,_thumbnail_id,10407,_edit_last,4,_yoast_wpseo_primary_category,,sbg_selected_sidebar,,sbg_selected_sidebar_replacement,,_snap_forceSURL,2,snap_MYURL,,snapEdIT,1,_yoast_wpseo_focuskw,important details,_yoast_wpseo_title,,,,,,,,,_yoast_wpseo_metadesc,What are the most important details to share with your trainer in order to take full advantage of your investment?

Well, rest assured with us that there won’t be anyone asking you to remortgage your house, or guilt-tripping you into spending money on something you may not actually want. No - our intro sessions are our way of allowing you to test the personal training experience. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>We get that personal training comes with a price tag, so we want you to try us first <em><strong>and then</strong></em><strong> decide if it is the right fit for you</strong>. Personal training works best when there is trust between the trainer and the client, AND when the client is really ready to be there. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you’re still not sure about signing up for the intro offer, here’s a breakdown of what exactly you can expect from the 8 sessions.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Session 1</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {""id"":10429,""align"":""left"",""width"":145,""height"":145} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""alignleft is-resized""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1-1024x1024.png"" alt=""intro session 1 - assessment"" class=""wp-image-10429"" width=""145"" height=""145""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The first session will be an assessment. It acts as an icebreaker between you and the first of your 2 trainers - your Key 1 trainer. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>They’ll take you through a few different exercises and ask some important questions to get a better sense of who you are. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>They will also assess how well your joints move through their range of motion; they’ll observe how comfortable you are with different weights, and begin the conversation about your lifestyle habits and nutrition. By the end of the first session, you’ll likely have a few bits of information that you can take home and start putting into practice.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Session 2</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {""id"":10430,""align"":""left"",""width"":145,""height"":156} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""alignleft is-resized""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-1024x1024.png"" alt=""intro session 2 - first workout"" class=""wp-image-10430"" width=""145"" height=""156""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The second session is where the real workouts begin. After the first session and reviewing your consultation info, the trainer will have the necessary info to put together a program for you. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Take this session to ask questions about specific exercises and let your trainer know what you’ve been doing outside of the gym to support the efforts in the gym. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you haven’t been able to make any lifestyle changes yet, ask your trainer for some guidance. They see people from all walks of life all day long and have a plethora of solutions for you to start making lifestyle changes that suit your current lifestyle. After all - trying to make too big of a change usually doesn’t go so well. The expertise of your trainer will come through as they help you to find the changes or modifications that are sustainable.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Session 3-5</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {""id"":10431,""align"":""left"",""width"":-218,""height"":-218} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""alignleft is-resized""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-1024x1024.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-10431"" width=""-218"" height=""-218""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Over the next few sessions, you’ll meet your second trainer - your Key 2 trainer. Having a second trainer will give you more flexibility with scheduling and give you access to more resources to help you along your fitness journey.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It also gives you another friendly face in the gym, making the gym a more familiar and inviting place to be.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>By around the 4th or 5th session, you should have a pretty good idea of how you would like to proceed. Some may realize that they’re not quite ready for the commitment of personal training - and that’s okay.<strong> We’ll always be here when you are ready</strong>.  If you decide not to continue, you still get to finish the 8 sessions. This is simply the time <em>that most people</em> decide to continue or not.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For those of you who do choose to continue, you have 3 more sessions to figure out with your trainer what plan of action will work best for you moving forward.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>Session 6-8</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {""id"":10432,""align"":""left"",""width"":165,""height"":165} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""alignleft is-resized""><img src=""https://freeformfitness.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4-1024x1024.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-10432"" width=""165"" height=""165""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>These final few sessions are where you take everything you’ve learned from the first 5 sessions and really start to push yourself.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Try increasing the intensity or asking for progressions for different exercises. At this point, you’ll be used to the routine of the sessions. You may have even made a few friends in the gym if you’ve maintained a consistent schedule.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In your final session, you’ll be retaking measurements to see what you’ve been able to achieve in the intro offer. These can be body measurements if your goal is based on body measurements, like weight and inches off the waist. If you have more qualitative goals, like more energy, there will be a discussion about the progress you’ve made with those goals as well.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you decided it wasn’t the time to continue with personal training, as we said before - <em>that’s okay</em>. We’ll always be here when you are ready to make personal training part of your lifestyle.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you have decided that you’re going to continue, make sure to use the final few sessions to really articulate what you hope to achieve in 6-12 months of personal training. Again - the more information and detail the better. <br></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>From session 1 to 8 our goal is to help educate, and to provide you with the resources to get you started. We understand the transformative power of personal training and the self-awareness and strength it can unlock. The intro sessions give us a chance to share that information with as many of you as possible. The intro sessions allow you to take the first step towards your health goals with someone there to guide you. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you are ready to give personal training a try, click the graphic at the bottom of this page to sign up for a free consultation.

Kettlebells are typically made of iron and weigh anywhere from 2kgs to 60kgs. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Humans have been using tools with a similar shape to kettlebells for years, but their popularity as a training tool began in the 1700s in Europe. It was a popular piece of equipment in Russia and became an important part of the strongman competitions as the sport evolved. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Today the kettlebell is a piece of equipment found in most gyms and with good reason. It is versatile and an exceptionally effective workout when used properly. So why should you consider training with a kettlebell? Here are the top 8 reasons from our kettlebell experts, Andrew Younis and Sean Rodgers.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2 id=""kettlebell-training-is-excellent-for-improving-balance""><strong>Reason 1: Kettlebell training is excellent for improving balance</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One of the most commonly known moves with the kettlebell is the kettlebell swing. You take the kettlebell in both hands, push the hips back while lowering the kettlebell. When you’re ready to start the swing you pull the kettlebell between the legs, and quickly drive the hips forward, pushing the kettlebell up to about shoulder level. You can see this exercise being demonstrated below:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {""url"":""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZrkFn3md-o"",""type"":""video"",""providerNameSlug"":""youtube"",""className"":""wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio""} --><figure class=""wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio""><div class=""wp-block-embed__wrapper"">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZrkFn3md-o
</div></figure><!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The shape and the distribution of weight in a kettlebell results in a dynamic center of gravity, or a center of gravity that is always changing. Because of this, your core muscles around the spine, pelvis, and ribs, are required to adjust and react at a very rapid rate. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} --><p class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>“<em>The constant changing centre of gravity pushes the body to constantly reshape and adjust, replicating those forces we see from daily tasks or even sporting events</em>” - </strong><a rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""Sean Rodgers (opens in a new tab)"" href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/team/sean-rodgers/"" target=""_blank"">Sean Rodgers</a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the real world, this translates to faster reaction times to things like slips, trips, and being pushed or forced in an unexpected direction. Think about skating on the canal: you hit an extra slippery patch, and now your smooth skating rhythm has been interrupted. Consistent kettlebell training will teach your core muscles to react to this quickly, correct the movement, and help keep you upright.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2 id=""They-provide-both-strength-and-cardio-benefits""><strong>Reason 2: They provide both strength and cardio benefits</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The strength training benefits of the kettlebell go beyond core training. Metcalfe Trainer, <a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/team/andrew-younis/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label=""Andrew Younis (opens in a new tab)"">Andrew Younis</a>, finds that the kettlebell bridges the gap between strength and cardio “which results in faster and more sustainable results.”</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the world of strength and conditioning, resistance circuit-based training, or RCT, is the standard. Trainers will use a sequence of exercises completed with very little rest between them to improve their client’s power, strength, and aerobic capacity (cardio).&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Kettlebells are an excellent tool for RCT. A <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26102260/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label="" (opens in a new tab)"">study in 2015</a> found that when female soccer players incorporated kettlebell training 3x/week for 4 weeks, they had a 6% gain in their oxygen uptake. This is a considerable gain from just 1 piece of equipment.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2 id=""Kettlebells-are-incredibly-versatile""><strong>Reason 3: Kettlebells are incredibly versatile</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Building upon reason 2, kettlebells are able to achieve power, strength, and cardio goals because the range of exercises that are possible is wide and impressive. As Andrew puts it “you don’t need 500 different pieces of equipment because of the kettlebell’s versatility.”</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In exercise there are 6 foundational movements - push, pull, knee dominant, hip dominant, unilateral, and core. We’ve already covered the kettlebell’s ability to strengthen the core, but it can also train the 4 remaining movements.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The handle on the kettlebell allows for many different grips or hand positions on the kettlebell. You can hold the kettlebell with 1 hand or two hands, swing it, use it for rows, press it overhead, or even use it for powerlifting movements like cleans and snatches. This infographic below only covers some of the exercises that are possible with a kettlebell.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {""align"":""center""} --><div class=""wp-block-image""><figure class=""aligncenter""><img src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/a3jmM2AcPU60gkCoCm9yu4UCGM_HCAAvPS4ete7vUu3GEYFaqGpmH9_MxtrevDmP0khjitHaKDxFR6qvNAOt7fqMe50N0vPGoCBxa6LVBkqO11B1T95LymP9X1dsTKVMIjfRG1Q_"" alt=""Training with Kettlebells: infographic of possible kettlebell workouts for upper body, core, back, and lower body""/></figure></div><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:heading --><h2 id=""Enjoy-an-efficient-and-effective-workout""><strong>Reason 4: Enjoy an efficient and effective workout </strong><strong><em>(with 1 piece of equipment).</em></strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Reason #4 ties together reason 2 and 3. If 1 piece of equipment has so many different uses and can achieve both strength and cardio goals, then you’ve found yourself the perfect piece of equipment. Instead of changing between multiple machines, bands, and dumbbells - although these all have their place in a workout - you can use just the kettlebell and get through every phase of your workout. As Sean says, the kettlebell is the best bang for your buck.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2 id=""The-Kettlebell-is-cost-effective""><strong>Reason 5: The Kettlebell is cost-effective</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>On that note, kettlebells are great for your wallet. If you’re looking to have something at home to help fill in the gaps between training days with your trainer, the kettlebell is an excellent choice. Although things like bands, small exercise balls, and dumbbells can be inexpensive, they lack the versatility of the kettlebell. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>On the other side of that, buying things like squat racks and cable machines can be incredibly expensive and require a lot of space in your house. For those of you who want something you can do in a small space without sacrificing your access to a wide range of exercises, then the kettlebell is the perfect piece of equipment for this.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""small""} --><p class=""has-small-font-size""><em>The<a href=""https://www.treadmillfactory.ca/kettlebells?matchtype=b&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;adposition=&amp;keyword=&amp;campaign=1394165236&amp;adgroup=54545390385&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwgdX4BRB_EiwAg8O8HX6aLwxTLGD_xcNmSTXOlrCI-YtDZhPMesARtagV65rtOsevPIgouxoClmsQAvD_BwE"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" aria-label="" (opens in a new tab)""> Treadmill Factory</a> has great deals on kettlebells for those of you who are interested.</em></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><em>The following 3 reasons are the more advanced reasons to train with a kettlebell.

It can be an excellent tool for beginners but also has many uses for more advanced clients and athletes.</em></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2 id=""Great-for-grip-strength""><strong>Reason 6: Great for Grip Strength</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One of the easiest ways to assess someone’s strength with grip strength. Without great grip strength, exercises like the deadlift become very difficult to progress. Grip strength is the measure of one’s hand and forearm strength and is an indicator of overall strength. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The kettlebell is able to strengthen these muscles and therefore improve grip strength because of the way a kettlebell is held. This makes it one of <a href=""https://freeformfitness.ca/team/andrew-younis/"">Andrew</a>'s favourite ways to train grip strength. You do not simply hold a kettlebell handle. If you hold a kettlebell without creating some tension in the arm, you end up with a weak movement - no matter what the movement is.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>A common exercise for improving grip strength is the farmer's carry/farmer walk. A kettlebell is a great piece of equipment for this. You can see this being demonstrated below by world-renowned trainer, Paul Chek:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {""url"":""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leWIG6Zokbo"",""type"":""video"",""providerNameSlug"":""youtube"",""className"":""wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio""} --><figure class=""wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio""><div class=""wp-block-embed__wrapper"">

</div></figure><!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube --><!-- wp:heading --><h2 id=""kettlebells-allow-you-to-train-through-greater-ranges-of-motion""><strong>Reason 7: Kettlebells allow you to train through greater ranges of motion.</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the weightlifting world, accessing the full range of motion means more potential force production. In the everyday world, training through the full range of motion means healthy joints and more balanced muscles around those joints.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} --><p class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong><em>""Kettlebells cross the bridge between strength training and cardiovascular training, as well as pushing you into extreme ranges of motion something completely lost with most modern people""</em></strong> - Sean Rodgers </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The kettlebell is capable of both of these things because of how we use the kettlebell. As we move, so does the kettlebell, which means that when we are swinging a kettlebell (For example), we are not only having to accelerate and decelerate our bodies, but we are also accelerating and decelerating the kettlebell.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In simpler terms try thinking about swinging your arm back and forth beside you. You know how to swing the arm forward, how to slow it down, and then swing it backwards. This is something we do every day without even thinking about it.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Now think about swinging that same arm, but now you have a briefcase in your hand. As you swing forward, you’ll notice that your arm travels a little higher as the weight of the briefcase keeps moving in that direction. The same is true as you swing the briefcase backwards.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This phenomenon is rooted in physics and Newton’s first law of motion: objects in motion stay in motion until acted on by an opposing force. When we train with a kettlebell, we add an additional object with its own individual mass that requires additional forces to slow it down. This translates to our bodies having to go further into their range of motion to allow for the kettlebell to slow down and change directions.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2 id=""stretch-reflex-recruitment-that-amplifies-power""><strong>Reason 8: Stretch Reflex Recruitment that Amplifies Power</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The final reason is Sean Rodger’s favourite reason for training with kettlebells. In our bodies, we have something called the stretch reflex. Like an elastic band, the further you stretch it the harder it snaps back. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Building upon reason 8 and the greater range of motion achieved with kettlebell training, this also engages this stretch reflex. By training the stretch reflex and training the body to recruit this reflex with greater efficacy, we are able to amplify the power of our movements.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Power is the result of both speed and strength. If you can move something very heavy, very quickly, you have power (hence, powerlifting). As we train with the kettlebell, we are training further into our range of motion. The further we go into our range of motion, the more we are able to lengthen and contract the muscles. The speed at which we can go from lengthening to contracting is where the prowess of power movements lies.&nbsp;</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you incorporate more kettlebell training into your routine, this stretch reflex recruitment will improve. This has applications not just for powerlifters, but also sprinters, swimmers, and boxers. Any activity that would benefit from the “elastic” to snap back quickly and with great force can benefit from kettlebell training.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading --><h2><strong>With great power comes great responsibility</strong></h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>A kettlebell is an incredible tool. From it’s versatility to its potential for strength, cardio, and power improvements, the kettlebell can do it all. Because it is able to do so much, it does require some training in order to use it safely and to use it correctly.
