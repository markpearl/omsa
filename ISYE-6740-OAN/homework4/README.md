Steps to Run the Program

1) Install the requirements file which contains all the python dependencies:
pip install -r ./requirements.txt

2) Install the egg containing the python src package and modules associated with the homework assignment
pip install -e .

3) Run the main script containing and view the results:
python -m ./Scripts/run_hw4_script.py

4) Results for outputs are in the reports/figures folder and in the src/data/model_output.csv. Output for matplotlib can be found in /reports/figures.
